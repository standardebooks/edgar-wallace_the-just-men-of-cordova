<h2><a name="chap01" id="chap01">I.&mdash;THREE MEN OF
CORDOVA</a></h2>



<p class="first">THE man who sat at the marble-topped table of
the Café of the Great Captain&mdash;if I translate the sign
aright&mdash;was a man of leisure. A tall man, with a trim beard
and grave grey eyes that searched the street absently as though
not quite certain of his quest. He sipped a coffee con leche and
drummed a little tune on the table with his slender white
hands.</p>

<p>He was dressed in black, which is the conventional garb in
Spain, and his black cloak was lined with velvet. His cravat was
of black satin, and his well-fitting trousers were strapped under
his pointed boots, in the manner affected by certain
caballero.</p>

<p>These features of his attire were the most striking, though he
was dressed conventionally enough&mdash;for Cordova. He might
have been a Spaniard, for grey eyes are a legacy of the Army of
Occupation, and many were the unions between Wellington's
rollicking Irishmen and the susceptible ladies of the
Estremadura.</p>

<p>His speech was flawl ess. He spoke with the lisp of Andalusia,
clipping his words as do the folk of the South. Also, there was
evidence of his Southern origin in his response to the whining
beggar that shuffled painfully to him, holding out crooked
fingers for largess.</p>

<p>"In the name of the Virgin, and the Saints, and the God who is
above all, I beseech you, señor, to spare me ten centimos."</p>

<p>The bearded man brought his far-seeing eyes to focus on the
palm.</p>

<p>"God will provide," he said, in the slurred Arabic of Spanish
Morocco.</p>

<p>"Though I live a hundred years," said the beggar monotonously,
"I will never cease to pray for your lordship's happiness."</p>

<p>He of the velvet-lined cloak looked at the beggar.</p>

<p>The mendicant was a man of medium height, sharp-featured,
unshaven, after the way of his kind, terribly bandaged across his
head and one eye.</p>

<p>Moreover, he was lame. His feet were shapeless masses of
swathed bandages, and his discoloured hands clutched a stick
fiercely.</p>

<p>"Señor and Prince," he whined, "there is between me and the
damnable pangs of hunger ten centimos, and your worship would not
sleep this night in comfort thinking of me tossing in
famine."</p>

<p>"Go in peace," said the other patiently.</p>

<p>"Exalted," moaned the beggar, "by the chico that lay on your
mother's knee"&mdash;he crossed himself&mdash;"by the gallery of
the Saints and the blessed blood of martyrs, I beseech you not to
leave me to die by the wayside, when ten centimos, which is as
the paring of your nails, would lead me to a full stomach."</p>

<p>The man at the table sipped his coffee unmoved.</p>

<p>"Go with God," he said.</p>

<p>Still the man lingered.</p>

<p>He looked helplessly up and down the sunlit street. He peered
into the cool dark recess of the café, where an apathetic waiter
sat at a table reading the Heraldo.</p>

<p>Then he leant forward, stretching out a slow hand to pick a
crumb of cake from the next table.</p>

<p>"Do you know Dr. Essley?" he asked in perfect English.</p>

<p>The cavalier at the table looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>"I do not know him. Why?" he asked in the same language.</p>

<p>"You should know him," said the beggar; "he is
interesting."</p>

<p>He said no more, shuffling a painful progress along the
street. The caballero watched him with some curiosity as he made
his way slowly to the next café. Then he clapped his hands
sharply, and the apathetic waiter, now nodding significantly over
his Heraldo, came suddenly to life, collected the bill, and a tip
which was in proportion to the size of the bill. Though the sky
was cloudless and the sun threw blue shadows in the street, those
same shadows were immensely cold, for these were the chilly days
before the first heat of spring.</p>

<p>The gentleman, standing up to his full height&mdash;he was
well over the six-feet mark&mdash;shook his cloak and lightly
threw one end across his shoulder; then he began to walk slowly
in the direction taken by the beggar.</p>

<p>The way led him through narrow streets, so narrow that in the
walls on either side ran deep recesses to allow the boxes of
cartwheels to pass. He overtook the man in the Calle Paraiso,
passed him, threading the narrow streets that led to San
Fernando. Down this he went, walking very leisurely, then turned
to the street of Carrera de Puente, and so came to the shadows of
the mosque-cathedral which is dedicated to God and to Allah with
delightful impartiality. He stood irresolutely before the gates
that opened on to the courtyards, seemed half in doubt, then
turned again, going downhill to the Bridge of Calahorra. Straight
as a die the bridge runs, with its sixteen arches that the
ancient Moors built. The man with the cloak reached the centre of
the bridge and leant over, watching with idle interest the
swollen yellow waters of the Guadalquivir.</p>

<p>Out of the corner of his eye he watched the beggar come slowly
through the gate and walk in his direction. He had a long time to
wait, for the man's progress was slow. At last he came sidling up
to him, hat in hand, palm outstretched. The attitude was that of
a beggar, but the voice was that of an educated Englishman.</p>

<p>"Manfred," he said earnestly, "you must see this man Essley. I
have a special reason for asking."</p>

<p>"What is he?"</p>

<p>The beggar smiled.</p>

<p>"I am dependent upon memory to a great extent," he said, "the
library at my humble lodgings being somewhat limited, but I have
a dim idea that he is a doctor in a suburb of London, rather a
clever surgeon."</p>

<p>"What is he doing here?"</p>

<p>The redoubtable Gonsalez smiled again.</p>

<p>"There is in Cordova a Dr. Cajalos. From the exalted
atmosphere of the Paseo de Gran Capitan, wherein I understand you
have your luxurious suite, no echo of the underworld of Cordova
comes to you. Here"&mdash;he pointed to the roofs and the untidy
jumble of buildings at the farther end of the bridge&mdash;"in
the Campo of the Verdad, where men live happily on two pesetas a
week, we know Dr. Cajalos. He is a household word&mdash;a
marvellous man, George, performing miracles undreamt of in your
philosophy: making the blind to see, casting spells upon the
guilty, and creating infallible love philtres for the innocent!
He'll charm a wart or arrest the ravages of sleeping
sickness."</p>

<p>Manfred nodded. "Even in the Paseo de la Gran Capitan he is
not without honour," he said with a twinkle in his eye. "I have
seen him and consulted him."</p>

<p>The beggar was a little astonished. "You're a wonderful man,"
he said, with admiration in his voice. "When did you do it?"</p>

<p>Manfred laughed softly.</p>

<p>"There was a certain night, not many weeks ago, when a beggar
stood outside the worthy doctor's door, patiently waiting till a
mysterious visitor, cloaked to his nose, had finished his
business."</p>

<p>"I remember," said the other, nodding. "He was a stranger from
Ronda, and I was curious&mdash;did you see me following him?"</p>

<p>"I saw you," said Manfred gravely. "I saw you from the corner
of my eye."</p>

<p>"It was not you?" asked Gonsalez, astonished.</p>

<p>"It was I," said the other. "I went out of Cordova to come
into Cordova."</p>

<p>Gonsalez was silent for a moment.</p>

<p>"I accept the humiliation," he said. "Now, since you know the
doctor, can you see any reason for the visit of a commonplace
English doctor to Cordova? He has come all the way without a halt
from England by the Algeciras Express. He leaves Cordova
to-morrow morning at daybreak by the same urgent system, and he
comes to consult Dr. Cajalos."</p>

<p>"Poiccart is here: he has an interest in this Essley&mdash;so
great an interest that he comes blandly to our Cordova, Baedeker
in hand, seeking information of the itinerant guide and
submitting meekly to his inaccuracies."</p>

<p>Manfred stroked his little beard, with the same grave
thoughtful expression in his wise eyes as when he had watched
Gonsalez shuffling from the Café de la Gran Capitan. "Life would
be dull without Poiccart," he said.</p>

<p>"Dull, indeed&mdash;ah, señor, my life shall be your praise,
and it shall rise like the smoke of holy incense to the throne of
Heaven."</p>

<p>He dropped suddenly into his whine, for a policeman of the
town guard was approaching, with a suspicious eye for the beggar
who stood with expectant hand outstretched.</p>

<p>Manfred shook his head as the policeman strolled up.</p>

<p>"Go in peace," he said.</p>

<p>"Dog," said the policeman, his rough hand descending on the
beggar's shoulder, "thief of a thief, begone lest you offend the
nostrils of this illustrious."</p>

<p>With arms akimbo, he watched the man limp away, then he turned
to Manfred.</p>

<p>"If I had seen this scum before, excellency," he said
fiercely, "I should have relieved your presence of his
company."</p>

<p>"It is not important," said Manfred conventionally.</p>

<p>"As for me," the policeman went on, releasing one hand from
his hip to curl an insignificant moustache, "I have hard work in
protecting rich and munificent caballeros from these swine. And
God knows my pay is poor, and with three hungry mouths to fill,
not counting my wife's mother, who comes regularly on feast days
and must be taken to the bull-fight, life is hard. More
especially, señor, since she is one of those damned proud
Andalusian women who must have a seat in the shade at two
pesetas*. For myself, I have not tasted rioja since the feast of
Santa Therese&mdash;"</p>

<p class="footnote">[*At a bull-fight the seats in the sun are
the cheaper, those in the shade being double the price.]</p>

<p>Manfred slipped a peseta into the hand of the uniformed
beggar. The man walked by his side to the end of the bridge,
retailing his domestic difficulties with the freedom and intimacy
which is possible nowhere else in the world. They stood
chattering near the principal entrance to the Cathedral.</p>

<p>"Your excellency is not of Cordova?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"I am of Malaga," said Manfred without hesitation.</p>

<p>"I had a sister who married a fisherman of Malaga," confided
the policeman. "Her husband was drowned, and she now lives with a
señor whose name I forget. She is a pious woman, but very
selfish. Has your excellency been to Gibraltar?"</p>

<p>Manfred nodded. He was interested in a party of tourists which
was being shown the glories of the Puerta del Perdon.</p>

<p>One of the tourists detached himself from his party and came
towards them. He was a man of middle height and strongly built.
There was a strange reserve in his air and a saturnine
imperturbability in his face.</p>

<p>"Can you direct me to the Passeo de la Gran Capitan?" he asked
in bad Spanish.</p>

<p>"I am going that way," said Manfred courteously; "if the señor
would condescend to accompany me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall be grateful," said the other.</p>

<p>They chatted a little on divers subjects&mdash;the weather,
the delightful character of the mosque-cathedral.</p>

<p>"You must come along and see Essley," said the tourist
suddenly. He spoke in perfect Spanish.</p>

<p>"Tell me about him." said Manfred. "Between you and Gonsalez,
my dear Poiccart, you have piqued my curiosity."</p>

<p>"This is an important matter," said the other earnestly.
"Essley is a doctor in a suburb of London. I have had him under
observation for some months. He has a small practice&mdash;quite
a little one&mdash;and he attends a few cases. Apparently he does
no serious work in his suburb, and his history is a strange one.
He was a student at University College, London, and soon after
getting his degree left with a youth named Henley for Australia.
Henley had been a hopeless failure and had been badly ploughed in
his exams, but the two were fast friends, which may account for
their going away together to try their luck in a new country.
Neither of them had a relation in the world, except Henley, who
had a rich uncle settled somewhere in Canada, and whom he had
never seen. Arrived in Melbourne, the two started off up country
with some idea of making for the new gold diggings, which were in
full swing at that time. I don't know where the diggings were; at
any rate, it was three months before Essley arrived&mdash;alone,
his companion having died on the road!"</p>

<p>"He does not seem to have started practising," Poiccart went
on, "for three or four years. We can trace his wanderings from
mining camp to mining camp, where he dug a little, gambled a lot,
and was generally known as Dr. S.&mdash; probably an abbreviation
of Essley. Not until he reached Western Australia did he attempt
to establish himself as a doctor. He had some sort of a practice,
not a very high-class one, it is true, but certainly lucrative.
He disappeared from Coolgardie in 1900; he did not reappear in
England until 1908."</p>

<p>They had reached the Passeo by now. The streets were better
filled than they had been when Manfred had followed the
beggar.</p>

<p>"I've some rooms here," he said. "Come in and we will have
some tea."</p>

<p>He occupied a flat over a jeweller's in the Calle Moreria. It
was a well-furnished apartment, "and especially blessed in the
matter of light," explained Manfred as he inserted the key. He
put a silver kettle on the electric stove.</p>

<p>"The table is laid for two?" questioned Poiccart.</p>

<p>"I have visitors," said Manfred with a little smile.
"Sometimes the begging profession becomes an intolerable burden
to our Leon and he enters Cordova by rail, a most respectable
member of society, full of a desire for the luxury of
life&mdash;and stories. Go on with yours, Poiccart; I am
interested."</p>

<p>The "tourist" seated himself in a deep arm-chair. "Where was
I?" he asked. "Oh, yes. Dr. Essley disappeared from Coolgardie,
and after an obliteration of eight years reappeared in
London."</p>

<p>"In any exceptional circumstances?"</p>

<p>"No, very ordinarily. He seems to have been taken up by the
newest kind of Napoleon."</p>

<p>"A Colonel Black?" asked Manfred, raising his eyebrows.</p>

<p>Poiccart nodded.</p>

<p>"That same meteor," he said. "At any rate, Essley, thanks to
what practice he could steal from other practitioners in his own
suburb&mdash;somewhere in the neighbourhood of Forest
Hill&mdash;and what practice Napoleon's recommendation gives him,
seems to be fairly well off. He first attracted my
attention&mdash;"</p>

<p>There came a tap at the door, and Manfred raised his finger
warningly. He crossed the room and opened the door. The concierge
stood outside, cap in hand; behind him and a little way down the
stairs was a stranger&mdash;obviously an Englishman.</p>

<p>"A señor to see your excellency," said the concierge.</p>

<p>"My house is at your disposal," said Manfred, addressing the
stranger in Spanish.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I do not speak good Spanish," said the man on the
stairs.</p>

<p>"Will you come up?" asked Manfred, in English.</p>

<p>The other mounted the stairs slowly.</p>

<p>He was a man of fifty. His hair was grey and long. His
eyebrows were shaggy, and his under-jaw stuck out and gave his
face an appearance which was slightly repulsive. He wore a black
coat and carried a big, soft wideawake in his gloved hand.</p>

<p>He peered round the room from one to the other.</p>

<p>"My name," he said, "is Essley."</p>

<p>He pronounced the word, lingering upon the double "ss" till it
sounded like a long hiss.</p>

<p>"Essley," he repeated as though he derived some satisfaction
from the repetition&mdash;"Dr. Essley."</p>

<p>Manfred motioned him to a chair, but he shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'll stand," he said harshly. "When I have business, I
stand." He looked suspiciously at Poiccart. "I have private
business," he said pointedly.</p>

<p>"My friend has my complete confidence," said Manfred.</p>

<p>He nodded grudgingly. "I understand," he said, "that you are a
scientist and a man of considerable knowledge of Spain."</p>

<p>Manfred shrugged his shoulders. In his present role he enjoyed
some reputation as a quasi-scientific litterateur, and under the
name of "de la Monte" had published a book on Modern Crime.</p>

<p>"Knowing this," said the man, "I came to Cordova, having other
business also&mdash;but that will keep."</p>

<p>He looked round for a chair and Manfred offered one, into
which he sat, keeping his back to the window.</p>

<p>"Mr. de la Monte," said the doctor, leaning forward with his
hands on his knees and speaking very deliberately, "you have some
knowledge of crime."</p>

<p>"I have written a book on the subject," said Manfred, "which
is not necessarily the same thing."</p>

<p>"I had that fear," said the other bluntly. "I was also afraid
that you might not speak English. Now I want to ask you a plain
question and I want a plain answer."</p>

<p>"So far as I can give you this, I shall be most willing," said
Manfred.</p>

<p>The doctor twisted his face nervously, then&mdash;"Have you
ever heard of the Four Just Men?" he asked.</p>

<p>There was a little silence.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Manfred calmly, "I have heard of them."</p>

<p>"Are they in Spain?" The question was put sharply.</p>

<p>"I have no exact knowledge," said Manfred. "Why do you
ask?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;" The doctor hesitated. "Oh, well&mdash;I am
interested. It is said that they unearth villainy that the law
does not punish; they&mdash;they kill&mdash;eh?" His voice was
sharper, his eyelids narrowed till he peered from one to the
other through slits.</p>

<p>"Such an organization is known to exist," said Manfred, "and
one knows that they do happen upon unpunished crime&mdash;and
punish."</p>

<p>"Even to&mdash;to killing?"</p>

<p>"They even kill," said Manfred gravely.</p>

<p>"And they go free!"&mdash;the doctor leapt to his feet with a
snarl and flung out his hands in protest&mdash;"they go free! All
the laws of all nations cannot trap them! A self-appointed
tribunal&mdash;who are they to judge and condemn? Who gave them
the right to sit in judgment? There is a law, if a man cheats
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>He checked himself suddenly, shook his shoulders and sank
heavily into the chair again.</p>

<p>"So far as I can secure information upon the subject," he said
roughly, "these men are no longer an active force&mdash;they are
outlawed&mdash;there are warrants for them in every country."</p>

<p>Manfred nodded.</p>

<p>"That is very true," he said gently; "but whether they are an
active force, time must reveal."</p>

<p>"There were three?"&mdash;the doctor looked up
quickly&mdash;"and they usually find a fourth&mdash;an
influential fourth."</p>

<p>Manfred nodded again. "So I understand."</p>

<p>Dr. Essley twisted uncomfortably in his chair. It was evident
that the information or assurance he expected to receive from
this expert in crime was not entirely satisfactory to him.</p>

<p>"And they are in Spain?" he asked.</p>

<p>"So it is said."</p>

<p>"They are not in France; they are not in Italy; they are not
in Russia; nor in any of the German States," said the doctor
resentfully. "They must be in Spain."</p>

<p>He brooded awhile in silence.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said Poiccart, who had been a silent listener,
"but you seem very interested in these men. Would it be offensive
to you if I asked you to satisfy my curiosity as to why you
should be anxious to discover their whereabouts?"</p>

<p>"Curiosity also," said the other quickly; "in a sense I am a
modest student of crime, as our friend de la Monte is."</p>

<p>"An enthusiastic student," said Manfred quietly.</p>

<p>"I hoped that you would be able to give me some help," Essley
went on, unmindful of the significant emphasis of the other's
tones; "beyond the fact that they may be in Spain, which, after
all, is conjectural, I have learnt nothing."</p>

<p>"They may not even be in Spain," said Manfred, as he
accompanied his visitor to the door; "they may not even be in
existence&mdash;your fears may be entirely groundless."</p>

<p>The doctor whipped round, white to the lips. "Fears?" he said,
breathing quickly. "Did you say fears?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry," laughed Manfred easily; "my English is perhaps
not good."</p>

<p>"Why should I fear them?" demanded the doctor aggressively.
"Why should I? Your words are chosen very unwisely, sir. I have
nothing to fear from the Four Just Men&mdash;or from any other
source."</p>

<p>He stood panting in the doorway like a man who is suddenly
deprived of breath. With an effort he collected himself,
hesitated a moment, and then with a stiff little bow left the
room.</p>

<p>He went down the stairs, out to the street, and turned into
the Passeo. There was a beggar at the corner who raised a languid
hand. "Por deos&mdash;" he whined.</p>

<p>With an oath, Essley struck at the hand with his cane, only to
miss it, for the beggar was singularly quick and, for all the
discomforts he was prepared to face, Gonsalez had no desire to
endure a hand seamed and wealed&mdash;those sensitive hands of
his were assets to Gonsalez.</p>

<p>The doctor pursued a savage way to his hotel. Reaching his
room, he locked the door and threw himself into a chair to think.
He cursed his own folly&mdash;it was madness to have lost his
temper even before so insignificant a person as a Spanish
dilettante in science. There was the first half of his mission
finished&mdash;and it was a failure. He took from the pocket of
his overcoat, hanging behind the door, a Spanish Baedeker. He
turned the leaves till he came to a map of Cordova. Attached to
this was a smaller plan, evidently made by somebody who knew the
topography of the place better than he understood the rules of
cartography.</p>

<p>He had heard of Dr. Cajalos first from a Spanish anarchist he
had met in some of his curious nocturnal prowlings in London.
Under the influence of good wine this bold fellow had invested
the wizard of Cordova with something approaching miraculous
powers&mdash;he had also said things which had aroused the
doctor's interest to an extraordinary degree. A correspondence
had followed: the visit was the result.</p>

<p>Essley looked at his watch. It was nearly seven o'clock. He
would dine, then go to his room and change. He made a hasty
ablution in the growing darkness of the room&mdash;curiously
enough he did not switch on the light; then he went to dinner. He
had a table to himself and buried himself in an English magazine
he had brought with him. Now and again as he read he would make
notes in a little book which lay on the table by the side of his
plate.</p>

<p>They had no reference to the article he read; they had little
association with medical science. On the whole, they dealt with
certain financial aspects of a certain problem which came into
his mind.</p>

<p>He finished his dinner, taking his coffee at the table. Then
he rose, put the little notebook in his pocket, the magazine
under his arm, and made his way back to his room. He turned on
the light, pulled down the blinds, and drew a light
dressing-table beneath the lamp. He produced his note-book again
and, with the aid of a number of closely-written sheets of paper
taken from his valise, he compiled a little table. He was
completely engrossed for a couple of hours. As if some invisible
and unheard alarum clock warned him of his engagement, he closed
the book, locked his memoranda in the valise, and struggled into
his coat. With a soft felt hat pulled down over his eyes, he left
the hotel and without hesitation took the path which led down to
the Calahorra Bridge. The streets through which he passed were
deserted, but he had no hesitation, knowing well the lawful
character of these unprepossessing little Spanish suburbs.</p>

<p>He plunged into a labyrinth of narrow streets&mdash;he had
studied his plan to some purpose&mdash;and only hesitated when he
reached a cul-de-sac which was more spacious than the street from
which it opened. One oil lamp at the farther end added rather to
the gloom. Tall, windowless houses rose on either side, and each
was pierced by a door. On the left door the doctor, after a
moment's hesitation, knocked twice.</p>

<p>Instantly it opened noiselessly. He hesitated.</p>

<p>"Enter," said a voice in Spanish; "the señor need not
fear."</p>

<p>He stepped into the black void and the door closed behind him.
"Come this way," said the voice. In the pitch darkness he could
make out the indistinct figure of a little man.</p>

<p>The doctor stepped inside and surreptitiously wiped the sweat
from his forehead. The old man lit a lamp, and Essley took stock
of him. He was very little, scarcely more than four feet in
height. He had a rough white beard and head as bald as an egg.
His face and hands were alike grimy, and his whole appearance
bore evidence of his aversion to water.</p>

<p>A pair of black twinkling eyes were set deeply in his head,
and the puckering lines about them revealed him as a man who
found humour in life. This was Dr. Cajalos, a famous man in
Spain, though he had no social standing.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Cajalos; "we will talk quietly, for I have a
señora of high quality to see me touching a matter of lost
affection."</p>

<p>Essley took the chair offered to him and the doctor seated
himself on a high stool by the table. A curious figure he made,
with his dangling little legs, his old, old face and his shining
bald pate.</p>

<p>"I wrote to you on the subject of certain occult
demonstrations," began the doctor, but the old man stopped him
with a quick jerk of the hand.</p>

<p>"You came to see me, señor, because of a drug I have
prepared," he said, "a preparation of&mdash;*"</p>

<p class="footnote">[* In the story, as it appeared in serial
form, the name of the poison occurred. It has been represented to
the author (and he agrees) that it is wholly undesirable that the
name of this drug should appear in a work of fiction. It is one
well known to oculists and its action is faithfully described in
these pages.]</p>

<p>Essley sprang to his feet. "I&mdash;I did not tell you so," he
stammered.</p>

<p>"The green devil told me," said the other seriously. "I have
many talks with the foot-draggers, and they speak very
truly."</p>

<p>"I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look!" said the old man. He leapt down from his high perch
with agility. In the dark corner of one of the rooms were some
boxes, to which he went. Essley heard a scuffling, and by and by
the old man came back, holding by the ears a wriggling rabbit.
With his disengaged hand he unstoppered a little green bottle on
the table. He picked a feather from the table, dipped the point
gingerly into the bottle. Then very carefully he lightly touched
the nose of the rabbit with the end of the feather&mdash;so
lightly, indeed, that the feather hardly brushed the muzzle of
the animal.</p>

<p>Instantly, with no struggle, the rabbit went limp, as though
the life essence had been withdrawn from the body. Cajalos
replaced the stopper and thrust the feather into a little
charcoal fire that burnt dully in the centre of the room.</p>

<p>"P&mdash;e," he said briefly; "but my preparation." He laid
the dead animal on the floor at the feet of the other. "Señor,"
he said proudly, "you shall take that animal and examine it; you
shall submit it to tests beyond patience; yet you shall not
discover the alkaloid that killed it."</p>

<p>"That is not so," said Essley, "for there will be a
contraction of the pupil which is an invariable sign."</p>

<p>"Search also for that," said the old man triumphantly.</p>

<p>Essley made the superficial tests. There was not even this
invariable symptom.</p>

<p>A dark figure, pressed close to the wall outside, listened. He
was standing by the shuttered window. He held to his ear a little
ebonite tube with a microphonic receiver, and the rubber which
covered the bell-like end was pressed against the shutter.</p>

<p>For half an hour he stood thus, almost motionless, then he
withdrew silently and disappeared into the shadows of the orange
grove that grew in the centre of the long garden.</p>

<p>As he did so, the door of the house opened and, with lantern
in hand, Cajalos showed his visitor into the street.</p>

<p>"The devils are greener than ever," chuckled the old man.
"Hey! there will be happenings, my brother!"</p>

<p>Essley said nothing. He wanted to be in the street again. He
stood quivering with nervous impatience as the old man unfastened
the heavy door, and when it swung open he almost leapt into the
street outside.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he said.</p>

<p>"Go with God," said the old man, and the door closed
noiselessly.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap02" id="chap02">II.&mdash;COLONEL BLACK,
FINANCIER</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE firm of Black and Gram had something of a
reputation in City circles. Gram might have been a man beyond
reproach&mdash;a veritable Bayard of finance, a churchgoer, and a
generous subscriber to charities. Indeed, Black complained with
good-humoured irritation&mdash;if the combination can be
visualized&mdash;that Gram would ruin him one of these fine days
by his quixotic munificence.</p>

<p>Gram allowed his heart to dictate to his head; he was too soft
for business, too retiring. The City was very sceptical about
Gram. It compared him with a certain Mrs. Harris, but Black did
not fly into a temper; he smiled mysteriously at all the
suspicion which the City entertained or expressed, and went on
deploring the criminal rustiness of a man who apparently sought,
by Black's account, to made the firm reputable in spite of the
rumours which centred about Colonel J. Black.</p>

<p>In this way did Black describe himself, though the Army list
was innocent of his name, and even a search through the
voluminous rolls of the American honorary ranks failed to reveal
any association.</p>

<p>Black and Gram floated companies and dealt largely in stocks
and shares. They recommended to their clients certain shares, and
the clients bought or sold according to the advice given, and at
the end of a certain period of time. Black and Gram wrote
politely regretting that the cover deposited had been exhausted,
and urgently requesting, with as little delay as possible, the
discharge of those liabilities which in some extraordinary
fashion the client had incurred. This, at any rate, was the
humble beginnings of a firm which was destined to grow to
important proportions. Gram went out of the business&mdash;was
never in it, if the truth be told. One doubts if he ever breathed
the breath of life&mdash;and Black grew in prosperity. His was a
name to conjure with in certain circles. In others it was never
mentioned. The financial lords of the City&mdash;the Farings, the
Wertheiners, the Scott-Teasons&mdash;had no official knowledge of
his existence. They went about their business calmly, loaning
their millions at a ridiculously small percentage, issuing
Government loans, discounting bills, buying bullion, and
such-like operations which filled the hours between eleven
o'clock, when their electric broughams set them down in
Threadneedle Street, and four o'clock, when their electric
broughams picked them up again. They read of Colonel Black in
their grave way, because there were days when he dominated the
financial columns. They read of his mighty stock deals, of his
Argentine electric deal, his rubber notations and his Canadian
copper mines. They read about him, neither approving nor
disapproving. They regarded him with that dispassionate interest
which a railway engine has for a motorcar.</p>

<p>When, on one never-to-be-forgotten occasion, he approached the
financial lords with a promising proposition, they "regretted
they were unable to entertain Colonel Black's interesting
suggestion." A little baffled, a little annoyed, he approached
the big American group, for it was necessary for the success of
his scheme that there should be names on his prospectus. Shrewd
fellows, these Americans, thought Colonel Black, and he set forth
his proposals in terms which were at once immodest and alluring.
In reply&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear friend," (it was one of those American businesses that
turn down a million dollars with five cents' worth of
friendship), "we have carefully considered your proposition, and
whilst we are satisfied that you will make money by its fruition,
we are not so certain that we shall."</p>

<p>Black came to the City of London one afternoon to attend a
board of directors' meeting. He had been out of town for a few
days, recruiting in advance, as he informed the board with a
touch of facetiousness, for the struggle that awaited him.</p>

<p>He was a man of middle height, broad of shoulder. His face was
thin and lank, his complexion sallow, with a curious uniform
yellowness. If you saw Colonel Black once you would never forget
him&mdash;not only because of that yellow face of his, that
straight black bar of eyebrow and the thin-lipped mouth, but the
very personality of the man impressed itself indelibly on the
mind of the observer.</p>

<p>His manner was quick, almost abrupt; his replies brusque. A
sense of finality marked his decisions. If the financial lords
knew him not, there were thousands that did. His name was a
household word in England. There was hardly a middle-class family
that did not hold his stock. The little "street punters" hung on
his word, his issues were subscribed for twice over. And he had
established himself in five years; almost unknown before, he had
risen to the dizziest heights in that short space of time.</p>

<p>Punctual to the minute, he entered the board-room of the suite
of offices he occupied in Moorgate Street.</p>

<p>The meeting had threatened to be a stormy one. Again an
amalgamation was in the air, and again the head of one group of
ironmasters&mdash;it was an iron combine he was forming&mdash;had
stood against the threats and blandishments of Black and his
emissaries.</p>

<p>"The others are weakening," said Fanks, that big, hairless
man; "you promised us that you would put him straight."</p>

<p>"I will keep my promise." said Black shortly.</p>

<p>"Widdison stood out, but he died," continued Fanks. "We can't
expect Providence to help us all the time."</p>

<p>Black's eyebrows lowered.</p>

<p>"I do not like jests of that kind," he said. "Sandford is an
obstinate man, a proud man; he needs delicate handling. Leave him
to me."</p>

<p>The meeting adjourned lamely enough, and Black was leaving the
room when Fanks beckoned to him.</p>

<p>"I met a man yesterday who knew your friend, Dr. Essley, in
Australia," he said.</p>

<p>"Indeed." Colonel Black's face was expressionless.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;he knew him in his very early days&mdash;he was
asking me where he could find him."</p>

<p>The other shrugged his shoulders. "Essley is abroad, I
think&mdash;you don't like him?"</p>

<p>Augustus Fanks shook his head. "I don't like doctors who come
to see me in the middle of the night, who are never to be found
when they are wanted, and are always jaunting off to the
Continent."</p>

<p>"He is a busy man," excused Black. "By the way, where is your
friend staying?"</p>

<p>"He isn't a friend, he's a sort of prospector, name of Weld,
who has come to London with a mining proposition. He is staying
at Varlet's Temperance Hotel in Bloomsbury."</p>

<p>"I will tell Essley when he returns," said Black, nodding his
head.</p>

<p>He returned to his private office in a thoughtful mood. All
was not well with Colonel Black. Reputedly a millionaire, he was
in the position of many a financier who counted his wealth in
paper. He had got so far climbing on the shadows. The substance
was still beyond his reach. He had organized successful
combinations, but the cost had been heavy. Millions had flowed
through his hands, but precious little had stuck. He was that
curious contradiction&mdash;a dishonest man with honest methods.
His schemes were financially sound, yet it had needed almost
superhuman efforts to get them through.</p>

<p>He was in the midst of an unpleasant reverie when a tap on the
door aroused him. It opened to admit Fanks. He frowned at the
intruder, but the other pulled up a chair and sat down. "Look
here, Black," he said, "I want to say something to you."</p>

<p>"Say it quickly."</p>

<p>Fanks took a cigar from his pocket and lit it. "You've had a
marvellous career," he said. "I remember when you started with a
little bucket-shop&mdash;well, we won't call it a bucket-shop,"
he said hastily as he saw the anger rising in the other's face,
"outside broker's. You had a mug&mdash;I mean an inexperienced
partner who found the money."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Not the mysterious Gram, I think?"</p>

<p>"His successor&mdash;there was nothing mysterious about
Gram."</p>

<p>"A successor named Flint?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He died unexpectedly, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"I believe he did," said Black abruptly.</p>

<p>"Providence again," said Fanks slowly; "then you got the whole
of the business. You took over the notation and a rubber company,
and it panned out. Well, after that you floated a tin mine or
something&mdash;there was a death there, wasn't there?"</p>

<p>"I believe there was&mdash;one of the directors; I forget his
name."</p>

<p>Fanks nodded. "He could have stopped the flotation&mdash;he
was threatening to resign and expose some methods of yours."</p>

<p>"He was a very headstrong man."</p>

<p>"And he died."</p>

<p>"Yes,"&mdash;a pause&mdash;"he died."</p>

<p>Fanks looked at the man who sat opposite to him.</p>

<p>"Dr. Essley attended him."</p>

<p>"I believe he did."</p>

<p>"And he died."</p>

<p>Black leant over the desk. "What do you mean?" he asked. "What
are you suggesting about my friend, Dr. Essley?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, except that Providence has been of some assistance
to you," said Fanks. "The record of your success is a record of
death&mdash;you sent Essley to see me once."</p>

<p>"You were ill."</p>

<p>"I was," said Fanks grimly, "and I was also troubling you a
little." He flicked the ash from his cigar to the carpet. "Black,
I'm going to resign all my directorships on your companies."</p>

<p>The other man laughed unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"You can laugh, but it isn't healthy, Black. I've no use for
money that is bought at too heavy a price."</p>

<p>"My dear man, you can resign," said Colonel Black, "but might
I ask if your extraordinary suspicions are shared by anybody
else?"</p>

<p>Fanks shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not at present," he said.</p>

<p>They looked at one another for the space of half a minute,
which was a very long time.</p>

<p>"I want to clear right out," Fanks continued. "I reckon my
holdings are worth £150,000&mdash;you can buy them."</p>

<p>"You amaze me," said Black harshly.</p>

<p>He opened a drawer of his desk and took out a little green
bottle and a feather. "Poor Essley," he smiled, "wandering about
Spain seeking the secrets of Moorish perfumery&mdash;he would go
off his head if he knew what you thought of him."</p>

<p>"I'd sooner he went off his head than that I should go off the
earth," said Fanks stolidly. "What have you got there?"</p>

<p>Black unstoppered the bottle and dipped in the feather. He
withdrew it and held it close to his nose.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Fanks curiously. For answer, Black held up
the feather for the man to smell.</p>

<p>"I can smell nothing," said Fanks. Tilting the end quickly
downwards. Black drew it across the lips of the other. "Here..."
cried Fanks, and went limply to the ground.</p>

<br>

<p><br>
"Constable Fellowe!"</p>

<p>Frank Fellowe was leaving the charge-room when he heard the
snappy tones of the desk-sergeant calling him.</p>

<p>"Yes, sergeant?" he said, with a note of inquiry in his voice.
He knew that there was something unpleasant coming. Sergeant
Gurden seldom took any opportunity of speaking to him, except in
admonishment. The sergeant was a wizen-faced man, with an ugly
trick of showing his teeth when he was annoyed, and no greater
contrast could be imagined than that which was afforded by the
tall, straight-backed young man in the constable's uniform,
standing before the desk, and the shrunken figure that sat on the
stool behind.</p>

<p>Sergeant Gurden had a dead-white face, which a scrubby black
moustache went to emphasize. In spite of the fact that he was a
man of good physical development, his clothing hung upon him
awkwardly, and indeed the station-sergeant was awkward in more
ways than one. Now he looked at Fellowe, showing his teeth. "I
have had another complaint about you," he said, "and if this is
repeated it will be a matter for the Commissioner."</p>

<p>The constable nodded his head respectfully. "I am very sorry,
sergeant," he said, "but what is the complaint?"</p>

<p>"You know as well as I do," snarled the other; "you have been
annoying Colonel Black again."</p>

<p>A faint smile passed across Fellowe's lips. He knew something
of the solicitude in which the sergeant held the colonel.</p>

<p>"What the devil are you smiling at?" snapped the sergeant. "I
warn you," he went on, "that you are getting very impertinent,
and this may be a matter for the Commissioner."</p>

<p>"I had no intention of being disrespectful, sergeant," said
the young man. "I am as tired of these complaints as you are, but
I have told you, as I will tell the Commissioner, that Colonel
Black lives in a house in Serrington Gardens and is a source of
some interest to me&mdash;that is my excuse."</p>

<p>"He complains that you are always watching the house," said
the sergeant, and Constable Fellowe smiled.</p>

<p>"That is his conscience working," he said. "Seriously,
sergeant, I happen to know that the colonel is not too friendly
disposed&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped himself.</p>

<p>"Well?" demanded the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Well," repeated Constable Fellowe, "it might be as well
perhaps if I kept my thoughts to myself."</p>

<p>The sergeant nodded grimly.</p>

<p>"If you get into trouble you will only have yourself to
blame," he warned. "Colonel Black is an influential man. He is a
ratepayer. Don't forget that, constable. The ratepayers pay your
salary, find the coat for your back, feed you&mdash;you owe
everything to the ratepayers."</p>

<p>"On the other hand," said the young man, "Colonel Black is a
ratepayer who owes me something."</p>

<p>Hitching his cape over his arm, he passed from the charge-room
down the stone steps into the street without. The man on duty at
the door bade him a cheery farewell.</p>

<p>Fellowe was an annoying young man, more annoying by reason of
the important fact that his antecedents were quite unknown to his
most intimate friends. He was a man of more than ordinary
education, quiet, restrained, his voice gently modulated; he had
all the manners and attributes of a gentleman.</p>

<p>He had a tiny little house in Somers Town where he lived
alone, but no friend of his, calling casually, had ever the good
fortune to find him at home when he was off duty. It was believed
he had other interests.</p>

<p>What those interests were could be guessed when, with
exasperating unexpectedness, he appeared in the amateur boxing
championship and carried off the police prize, for Fellowe was a
magnificent boxer&mdash;hard-hitting, quick, reliable,
scientific.</p>

<p>The bad men of Somers Town were the first to discover this,
and one, Grueler, who on one never-to-be-forgotten occasion had
shown fight on the way to the station, testified before
breathless audiences as to the skill and science of the young
man.</p>

<p>His breezy independence had won for him many friends, but it
had made him enemies too, and as he walked thoughtfully along the
street leading from the station, he realized that in the sergeant
he had an enemy of more than average malignity.</p>

<p>Why should this be? It puzzled him. After all, he was only
doing his duty. That he was also exceeding his duty did not
strike him as being sufficient justification for the resentment
of his superior, for he had reached the enthusiastic age of life
where only inaction was unpardonable. As to Black, Frank shrugged
his shoulders. He could not understand it. He was not of a nature
to suspect that the sergeant had any other motive than the
perfectly natural desire which all blase superiors have, to check
their too impulsive subordinates.</p>

<p>Frank admitted to himself that he was indeed a most annoying
person, and in many ways he understood the sergeant's antagonism
to himself. Dismissing the matter from his mind, he made his way
to his tiny house in Croome Street and let himself into his small
dining-room.</p>

<p>The walls were distempered, and the few articles of furniture
that were within were such as are not usually met with in houses
of this quality. The old print above the mantelpiece must have
been worth a working-man's annual income. The small gate-legged
table in the centre of the felt-covered floor was indubitably
Jacobean, and the chairs were Sheraton, as also was the
sideboard. Though the periods may not have harmonized, there is
harmony enough in great age. A bright fire was burning in the
grate, for the night was bitterly cold. Fellowe stopped before
the mantelpiece to examine two letters which stood awaiting him,
replaced them from where he had taken them, and passed through
the folding doors of the room into a tiny bedroom.</p>

<p>He had an accommodating landlord. Property owners in Somers
Town, and especially the owners of small cottages standing on
fairly valuable ground, do not as a rule make such renovations as
Fellowe required. The average landlord, for instance, would not
have built the spacious bathroom which the cottage boasted, but
then Fellowe's landlord was no ordinary man.</p>

<p>The young man bathed, changed himself into civilian clothing,
made himself a cup of tea, and, slipping into a long overcoat
which reached to his heels, left the house half an hour after he
had entered.</p>

<p>Frank Fellowe made his way West. He found a taxi-cab at King's
Cross and gave an address in Piccadilly. Before he had reached
that historic thoroughfare he tapped at the window-glass and
ordered the cabman to drop him.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock that night Sergeant Gurden, relieved from
his duty, left the station-house. Though outwardly taciturn and
calm, he was boiling internally with wrath.</p>

<p>His antipathy to Fellowe was a natural one, but it had become
intensified during the past few weeks by the attitude which the
young man had taken up towards the sergeant's protege.</p>

<p>Gurden was as much of a mystery to the men in his division as
Fellowe, and even more so, because the secrecy which surrounded
Gurden's life had a more sinister import than the reservation of
the younger man.</p>

<p>Gurden was cursed with an ambition. He had hoped at the outset
of his career to have secured distinction in the force, but a
lack of education, coupled with an address which was apt to be
uncouth and brusque, had militated against his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>He had recognized the limitations placed upon his powers by
the authorities over him. He had long since come to realize that
hope of promotion, first to an inspectorship, and eventually to
that bright star which lures every policeman onward, and which is
equivalent to the baton popularly supposed to be in every
soldier's knapsack, a superintendentship, was not for him.</p>

<p>Thwarted ambition had to find a new outlet, and he
concentrated his attention upon acquiring money. It became a
passion for him, an obsession. His parsimony, his meanness, and
his insatiable greed were bywords throughout the Metropolitan
police force.</p>

<p>It had become a mania with him, this collecting of money, and
his bitterest enmity was reserved for those who placed the
slightest obstacle between the officer and the gratification of
his ambitions.</p>

<p>It must be said of Colonel Black that he had been most kind.
Cupidity takes a lenient view of its benefactor's morals, and
though Sergeant Gurden was not the kind of man willingly to help
the lawless, no person could say that an outside broker,
undetected of fraud, was anything but a desirable member of
society.</p>

<p>Black had made an appointment with him. He was on his way now
to keep it. The colonel lived in one of those one-time
fashionable squares in Camden Town. He was obviously well off,
ran a car of his own, and had furnished No. 60 Serrington
Gardens, with something like lavish comfort.</p>

<p>The sergeant had no time to change. There was no necessity, he
told himself, for his relations with Black were of such a
character that there was no need to stand on ceremony.</p>

<p>The square was deserted at this time of night, and the
sergeant made his way to the kitchen entrance in the basement and
rang the bell. The door was opened almost instantly by a
man-servant.</p>

<p>"Is that you, sergeant?" said a voice from the darkness, as
Gurden made his way upstairs to the unlighted hall above. Colonel
Black turned on the light. He held out a long muscular hand in
welcome to the police officer. "I am so glad you have come," he
said.</p>

<p>The sergeant took the hand and shook it warmly. "I have come
to apologize to you. Colonel Black," he said. "I have severely
reprimanded Police-Constable Fellowe."</p>

<p>Black waved his hand deprecatingly. "I do not wish to get any
member of your admirable force into trouble," he said, "but
really this man's prying into my business is inexcusable and
humiliating."</p>

<p>The sergeant nodded. "I can well understand your annoyance,
sir," he said, "but you will understand that these young
constables are always a little over-zealous, and when a man is
that way he is inclined to overdo it a little."</p>

<p>He spoke almost pleadingly in his desire to remove any bad
impression that might exist in Black's mind as to his own part in
Police-Constable Fellowe's investigations.</p>

<p>Black favoured him with a gracious bow.</p>

<p>"Please do not think of it, I beg of you," he said. "I am
perfectly sure that the young constable did not intend willingly
to hurt my <i>amour-propre</i>."</p>

<p>He led the way to a spacious dining-room situated at the back
of the house. Whisky and cigars were on the table. "Help
yourself, sergeant," said Colonel Black. He pushed a big
comfortable chair forward.</p>

<p>With a murmured word of thanks, the sergeant sank into its
luxurious depths. "I am due back at the station in half an hour,"
he said, "if you will excuse me then."</p>

<p>Black nodded. "We shall be able to do our business in that
time," he said, "but before we go any further, let me thank you
for what you have already done."</p>

<p>From the inside pocket of his coat he took a flat pocket-book,
opened it and extracted two bank-notes. He laid them on the table
at the sergeant's elbow. The sergeant protested feebly, but his
eyes twinkled at the sight of the crinkling paper. "I don't think
I have done anything to deserve this," he muttered.</p>

<p>Colonel Black smiled, and his big cigar tilted happily. "I pay
well for little services, sergeant," he said. "I have many
enemies&mdash;men who will misrepresent my motives&mdash;and it
is essential that I should be forewarned."</p>

<p>He strode up and down the apartment thoughtfully, his hands
thrust into his trousers pockets.</p>

<p>"It is a hard country, England," he said, "for men who have
had the misfortune to dabble in finance."</p>

<p>Sergeant Gurden murmured sympathetically.</p>

<p>"In our business, sergeant," the aggrieved colonel went on,
"it frequently happens that disappointed people&mdash;people who
have not made the profits which they anticipated&mdash;bring
extraordinary accusations against those responsible for the
conduct of those concerns in which their money is invested. I had
a letter to-day"&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"accusing
me&mdash;me!&mdash;of running a bucket-shop."</p>

<p>The sergeant nodded; he could well understand that aspect of
speculation.</p>

<p>"And one has friends," Black went on, striding up and down the
apartment, "one has people one wants to protect against similar
annoyances&mdash;take my friend Dr. Essley&mdash;Essley, E double
s ley," he spelt the name carefully; "you have heard of him?"</p>

<p>The sergeant had not heard of any such body, but was willing
to admit that he had.</p>

<p>"There is a man," said the colonel, "a man absolutely at the
head of his profession&mdash;I shouldn't be surprised to learn
that even he is no safer from the voice of slander."</p>

<p>The sergeant thought it very likely, and murmured to the
effect.</p>

<p>"There is always a possibility that malignity will attach
itself to the famous," the colonel continued, "and because I know
that you would be one of the first to hear such slander, and that
you would moreover afford me an opportunity&mdash;a private
opportunity&mdash;of combating such slander, that I feel such
security. God bless you, sergeant!" He patted the other's
shoulder, and Gurden was genuinely affected.</p>

<p>"I can quite understand your position, sir," he said, "and you
may be sure that when it is possible to render you any assistance
I shall be most happy and proud to render it."</p>

<p>Again Colonel Black favoured his visitor with a little
pat.</p>

<p>"Or to Dr. Essley," he said; "remember the name. Now,
sergeant," he went on, "I sent for you to-night,"&mdash;he
shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"when I say sent for you, that, of
course, is an exaggeration. How can a humble citizen like myself
command the services of an officer of the police?"</p>

<p>Sergeant Gurden fingered his moustache self-consciously.</p>

<p>"It is rather," the colonel went on, "that I take advantage of
your inestimable friendship to seek your advice."</p>

<p>He stopped in his walk, drew a chair opposite to where the
sergeant was sitting, and seated himself.</p>

<p>"Constable Fellowe, the man of whom I have complained, had the
good fortune to render a service to the daughter of Mr. Theodore
Sandford&mdash;I see you know the gentleman."</p>

<p>The sergeant nodded; he had heard of Mr. Theodore Sandford, as
who had not? For Theodore Sandford was a millionaire ironmaster
who had built a veritable palace at Hampstead, had purchased the
Dennington "Velasquez," and had presented it to the nation.</p>

<p>"Your constable," continued Colonel Black, "sprang upon a
motor-car Miss Sandford was driving down a steep hill, the brakes
of which had gone wrong, and at some risk to himself guided the
car through the traffic when, not to put too fine a point on it,
Miss Sandford had lost her head."</p>

<p>"Oh, it was him, was it?" said the sergeant disparagingly.</p>

<p>"It was him," agreed the colonel out of sheer politeness. "Now
these young people have met unknown to the father of Miss
Sandford, and&mdash;well, you understand."</p>

<p>The sergeant did not understand, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"I do not suggest," said the colonel, "that there is anything
wrong&mdash;but a policeman, sergeant, not even an officer like
yourself&mdash;a policeman!"</p>

<p>Deplorable! said the sergeant's head, eyes and hands.</p>

<p>"For some extraordinary reason which I cannot fathom," the
colonel proceeded, "Mr. Sandford tolerates the visits of this
young man; that, I fear, is a matter which we cannot go into, but
I should like you&mdash;well, I should like you to use your
influence with Fellowe."</p>

<p>Sergeant Gurden rose to depart. He had no influence, but some
power. He understood a little of what the other man was driving
at, the more so when&mdash;</p>

<p>"If this young man gets into trouble, I should like to know,"
said Colonel Black, holding out his firm hand; "I should like to
know very much indeed."</p>

<p>"He is a rare pushful fellow, that Fellowe," said the sergeant
severely. "He gets to know the upper classes in some way that I
can't understand, and I dare say he has wormed himself into their
confidence. I always say that the kitchen is the place for the
policeman, and when I see a constable in the drawing-room I begin
to suspect things. There is a great deal of corruption&mdash;" He
stopped, suddenly realizing that he himself was in a
drawing-room, and that corruption was an ugly and an incongruous
word.</p>

<p>Colonel Black accompanied him to the door.</p>

<p>"You understand, sergeant," he said, "that this
man&mdash;Fellowe, did you call him?&mdash;may make a report over
your head or behind your back. I want you to take great care that
such a report, if it is made, shall come to me. I do not want to
be taken by surprise. If there is any charge to answer I want to
know all about it in advance. It will make the answering ever so
much easier, as I am a busy man."</p>

<p>He shook hands with the sergeant and saw him out of the
house.</p>

<p>Sergeant Gurden went back to the station with a brisk step and
a comforting knowledge that the evening had been well spent.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="chap03" id="chap03">III.&mdash;AN ADVENTURE IN
PIMLICO</a></h2>

<p class="first">IN the meantime our constable had reached a
small tavern in the vicinity of Regent Street. He entered the bar
and, ordering a drink, took a seat in the corner of the spacious
saloon. There were two or three people about; there were two or
three men drinking at the bar and talking&mdash;men in loud
suits, who cast furtive glances at every new-comer. He knew them
to be commonplace criminals of the first type. They did not
engage his attention: he flew higher.</p>

<p>He sat in the corner, apparently absorbed in an evening paper,
with his whisky and soda before him scarcely touched, waiting. It
was not the first time he had been here, nor would it be the
first time he had waited without any result. But he was patient
and dogged in the pursuit of his object.</p>

<p>The clock pointed to a quarter after ten, when the swing-doors
were pushed open and two men entered. For the greater part of
half an hour the two were engaged in a low-voiced consultation.
Over his paper Frank could see the face of Sparks. He was the
jackal of the Black gang, the man-of-all-trades. To him were
deputed the meanest of Black's commissions, and worthily did he
serve his master. The other was known to Frank as Jakobs, a
common thief and a pensioner of the benevolent colonel.</p>

<p>The conversation was punctuated either by glances at the clock
above the bar or at Sparks' watch, and at a quarter to eleven the
two men rose and went out. Frank followed, leaving his drink
almost untouched.</p>

<p>The men turned into Regent Street, walked a little way up, and
then hailed a taxi. Another cab was passing. Frank beckoned it.
"Follow that yellow cab," he said to the driver, "and keep a
reasonable distance behind, and when it sets down, pass it and
drop me farther along the street."</p>

<p>The man touched his cap. The two cabs moved on. They went in
the direction of Victoria, passed the great station on the left,
turned down Grosvenor Road on the right, and were soon in the
labyrinth of streets that constitute Pimlico. The first cab
pulled up at a big gaunt house in a street which had once been
fashionable, but which now hovered indescribably between slums
and shabby gentility. Frank saw the two men get out, and
descended himself a few hundred yards farther along on the
opposite side of the street. He had marked the house. There was
no difficulty in distinguishing it; a brass plate was attached to
the door announcing it to be an employment agency&mdash;as,
indeed, it was.</p>

<p>His quarry had entered before he strode across towards the
house. He crossed the road and took a position from whence he
could watch the door. The half-hour after twelve had chimed from
a neighbouring church before anything happened. A policeman on
his beat had passed Frank with a resentful sidelong glance, and
the few pedestrians who were abroad at that hour viewed him with
no less suspicion.</p>

<p>The chime of the neighbouring church had hardly died away when
a private car came swiftly along the road and pulled up with a
jerk in front of the house. A man descended. From where he stood
Frank had no difficulty in recognizing Black. That he was
expected was evident from the fact that the door was immediately
opened to him.</p>

<p>Three minutes later another car came down the street and
stopped a few doors short of the house, as though the driver was
not quite certain as to which was his destination. The newcomer
was a stranger to Frank. In the uncertain light cast by a street
lamp he seemed to be fashionably dressed. As he turned to give
instructions to his chauffeur, Fellowe caught a glimpse of a
spotless white shirt-front beneath the long dark overcoat. He
hesitated at the foot of the steps which led to the door, and
ascended slowly and fumbled for a moment at the bell. Before he
could touch it the door opened. There was a short parley as the
new man entered.</p>

<p>Frank, waiting patiently on the other side of the road, saw a
light appear suddenly on the first floor.</p>

<p>Did he but know, this gathering was in the nature of a board
meeting, a board meeting of a company more heavily financed than
some of the most respected houses in the City, having its
branches in various parts of the world, its agents, its business
system&mdash;its very books, if they could be found and the
ciphered entries unravelled.</p>

<p>Black sat at one end of the long table and the last arrival at
the other. He was a florid young man of twenty-six, with a weak
chin and a slight yellow moustache. His face would be familiar to
all racing men, for this was the sporting baronet, Sir Isaac
Tramber. There was something about Sir Isaac which kept him on
the outside fringe of good society, in spite of the fact that he
came of a stock which was indelibly associated with England's
story: the baronetcy had been created as far back as the
seventeenth century. It was a proud name, and many of his
ancestors had borne it proudly. None the less, his name was
taboo, his invitations politely refused, and never
reciprocated.</p>

<p>There had been some unfathomable scandal associated with his
name. Society is very lenient to its children. There are crimes
and sins which it readily, or if not readily, at any rate
eventually, forgives and condones, but there are some which are
unpardonable, unforgivable. Once let a man commit those crimes,
or sin those sins, and the doors of Mayfair are closed for ever
against him. Around his head was a cloud of minor scandal, but
that which brought down the bar of good society was the fact that
he had ridden his own horse at one of the Midland meetings. It
had started a hot favourite&mdash;five to two on.</p>

<p>The circumstances of that race are inscribed in the annals of
the Jockey Club. How an infuriated mob broke down the barriers
and attempted to reach this amateur jockey was ably visualized by
the sporting journalists who witnessed the extraordinary affair.
Sir Isaac was brought before the local stewards and the case
submitted to the stewards of the Jockey Club. The next issue of
the Racing Calendar contained the ominous announcement that Sir
Isaac Tramber had been "warned off" Newmarket Heath.</p>

<p>Under this ban he sat for four years, till the withdrawal of
the notice. He might again attend race-meetings and own horses,
and he did both, but the ban of society, that unwritten "warning
off" notice, had not been withdrawn. The doors of every decent
house were closed to him. Only one friend he had in the
fashionable world, and there were people who said that the Earl
of Verlond, that old and crabbed and envenomed man, merely
championed his unpromising protégé out of sheer perversity, and
there was ample justification for this contention of a man who
was known to have the bitterest tongue in Europe.</p>

<p>The descent to hell is proverbially easy, and Sir Isaac
Tramber's descent was facilitated by that streak of decadence
which had made itself apparent even in his early youth. As he sat
at one end of the board-table, both hands stuffed into his
trousers pockets, his head on one side like a perky bird, he
proved no mean man of business, as Black had discovered earlier
in their acquaintanceship.</p>

<p>"We are all here now, I think," said Black, looking humorously
at his companion. They had left Sparks and his friend in a room
below. "I have asked you to come to-night," he said, "to hear a
report of this business. I am happy to tell you that we have made
a bigger profit this year than we have ever made in the course of
our existence."</p>

<p>He went on to give details of the work for which he had been
responsible, and he did so with the air and in the manner of one
who was addressing a crowded board-room.</p>

<p>"People would say," said the colonel oracularly, "that the
business of outside broker is inconsistent with my acknowledged
position in the world of finance; therefore I deem it expedient
to dissociate myself from our little firm. But the outside broker
is a useful person&mdash;especially the outside broker who has a
hundred thousand clients. There are stocks of mine which he can
recommend with every evidence of disinterestedness, and just now
I am particularly desirous that these stocks should be
recommended."</p>

<p>"Do we lose anything by Fanks' death?" asked the baronet
carelessly. "Hard luck on him, wasn't it? But he was awfully
fat."</p>

<p>The colonel regarded the questioner with a calm stare. "Do not
let us refer to Fanks," he said evenly. "The death of Fanks has
very much upset me&mdash;I do not wish to speak about it."</p>

<p>The baronet nodded. "I never trusted him, poor chap," he said,
"any more than I trusted the other chap who made such an awful
scene here a year ago&mdash;February, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the colonel briefly.</p>

<p>"It's lucky for us he died too." said the tactless aristocrat,
"because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll get on with the business." Colonel Black almost snarled
the words. But the baronet had something to say. He was troubled
about his own security. It was when Black showed some sign of
ending the business that Sir Isaac leant forward impatiently.</p>

<p>"There is one thing we haven't discussed, Black," he said.</p>

<p>Black knew what the thing was, and had carefully avoided
mention of the subject. "What is it?" he asked innocently.</p>

<p>"These fellows who are threatening us, or rather threatening
you; they haven't any idea who it is who is running the show,
have they?" he asked, with some apprehension.</p>

<p>Black shook his head smilingly. "I think not," he said. "You
are speaking, of course, of the Four Just Men."</p>

<p>Sir Isaac gave a short nod. "Yes," Black went on, with an
assumption of indifference, "I have had an anonymous letter from
these gentlemen. As a matter of fact, my dear Sir Isaac, I
haven't the slightest doubt that the whole thing is a bluff."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by a bluff?" demanded the other.</p>

<p>Black shrugged his shoulders. "I mean that there is no such
organization as the Four Just Men. They are a myth. They have no
existence. It is too melodramatic for words. Imagine four people
gathered together to correct the laws of England. It savours more
of the sensational novel than of real life." He laughed with
apparent ease. "These things," he said, wagging his finger
jocosely at the perturbed baronet, "do not happen in Pimlico. No,
I suspect that our constable, the man I spoke to you about, is at
the bottom of it. He is probably the whole Four of these
desperate conspirators." He laughed again.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac fingered his moustache nervously. "It's all rot to
say they don't exist; we know what they did six years ago, and I
don't like this other man a bit," he grumbled.</p>

<p>"Don't like which other man?"</p>

<p>"This interfering policeman," he replied irritably. "Can't he
be squared?"</p>

<p>"The constable?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you can square constables, I suppose, if you can square
sergeants." Sir Isaac Tramber had the gift of heavy sarcasm.</p>

<p>Black stroked his chin thoughtfully. "Curiously enough," he
said, "I have never thought of that. I think we can try." He
glanced at his watch. "Now I'll ask you just to clear out," he
said. "I have an appointment at half-past one."</p>

<p>Sir Isaac smiled slowly. "Rather a curious hour for an
appointment," he said.</p>

<p>"Ours is a curious business," replied Colonel Black.</p>

<p>They rose, and Sir Isaac turned to Black. "What is the
appointment?" he asked.</p>

<p>Black smiled mysteriously. "It is rather a peculiar case," he
began.</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly. There were hurried footsteps on the
stairs without. A second later the door was flung open and Sparks
burst into the room. "Guv'nor," he gasped, "they're watching the
house."</p>

<p>"Who is watching?"</p>

<p>"There's a busy on the other side of the road," said the man,
speaking graphically. "I spotted him, and the moment he saw I
noticed him he moved off. He's back again now. Me and Willie have
been watching him."</p>

<p>The two followed the agitated Sparks downstairs, where from a
lower window they might watch, unobserved, the man who dared spy
on their actions.</p>

<p>"If this is the police," fumed Black, "that dog Gurden has
failed me. He told me Scotland Yard were taking no action
whatever."</p>

<p>Frank, from his place of observation, was well aware that he
had caused some consternation. He had seen Sparks turn back
hurriedly with Jakobs and re-enter the house. He observed the
light go out suddenly on the first floor, and now he had a pretty
shrewd idea that they were watching him through the glass panel
of the doorway.</p>

<p>There was no more he could learn. So far his business had been
a failure. It was no secret to him that Sir Isaac Tramber was an
associate of Black's, or that Jakobs and estimable Sparks were
also partners in this concern. He did not know what he hoped to
find, or what he had hoped to accomplish.</p>

<p>He was turning away in the direction of Victoria when his
attention was riveted on the figure of a young man which was
coming slowly along on the opposite sidewalk, glancing from time
to time at the numbers which were inscribed on the fanlights of
the doors. He watched him curiously, then in a flash he realized
his objective as he stopped in front of No. 63.</p>

<p>In half a dozen steps he had crossed the road towards him. The
boy&mdash;he was little more&mdash;turned round, a little
frightened at the sudden appearance. Frank Fellowe walked up to
him and recognized him. "You need not be scared," he said, "I am
a police officer. Are you going into that house?"</p>

<p>The young man looked at him for a moment and made no reply.
Then, in a voice that shook, he said "Yes."</p>

<p>"Are you going there to give Colonel Black certain information
about your employer's business?" The young man seemed hypnotized
by fear. He nodded. "Is your employer aware of the fact?"</p>

<p>Slowly he shook his head. "Did he send you?" he asked
suddenly, and Frank observed a note of terror in his voice.</p>

<p>"No," he smiled, wondering internally who the "he" was. "I am
here quite on my own, and my object is to warn you against
trusting Colonel Black."</p>

<p>He jerked up his head, and Frank saw the flush that came to
his face. "You are Constable Fellowe," he said suddenly.</p>

<p>To say that Frank was a little staggered is to express the
position mildly. "Yes," he repeated, "I am Constable
Fellowe."</p>

<p>Whilst he was talking the door of the house had opened. From
the position in which he stood Frank could not see this. Black
merged stealthily and came down the steps towards him.</p>

<p>The agent had no other desire than to discover the identity of
the man who was shadowing him. He was near enough to hear what
the young man said.</p>

<p>"Fellowe," he boomed, and came down the rest of the steps at a
run. "So it's you, is it?" he snarled. "It's you interfering with
my business again."</p>

<p>"Something like that," said Frank coolly.</p>

<p>He turned to the young man again.</p>

<p>"I tell you," he said in a tone of authority, "that if you go
into this house, or have anything whatever to do with this man,
you will regret it to the last day of your life."</p>

<p>"You shall pay for this!" fumed Black. "I'll have your coat
from your back, constable. I'll give you in charge.
I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have an excellent opportunity," said Frank. His quick eye
had detected the figure of a constable on the other side of the
road, walking slowly towards them. "There's a policeman over
there; call him now and give me in charge. There is no reason why
you shouldn't&mdash;no reason why you should want to avoid
publicity of the act."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" It was the youth who spoke. "Colonel Black, I
must come another time." He turned furiously on Frank. "As to
you&mdash;" he began, gaining courage from Black's presence.</p>

<p>"As to you," retorted Frank, "avoid bad company!"</p>

<p>He hesitated, then turned and walked quickly away, leaving the
two men alone on the pavement.</p>

<p>The three watchers in the hall eyed the scene curiously, and
two of them at least anticipated instructions from Black which
would not be followed by pleasant results for Frank.</p>

<p>With an effort, however, Black controlled his temper. He, too,
had seen the shadow on the other side of the road.</p>

<p>"Look here, Constable Fellowe," he said, with forced
geniality, "I know you're wrong, and you think you're right. Just
come inside and let's argue this matter out."</p>

<p>He waited, his nimble mind evolving a plan for dealing with
this dangerous enemy. He did not imagine that Frank would accept
the invitation, and he was genuinely astounded when, without
another word, the constable turned and slowly ascended the steps
to the door.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap04" id="chap04">IV.&mdash;THE MEN WHO SAT IN
JUDGMENT</a></h2>

<p class="first">FRANK heard a little scuffling in the hall, and
knew that the men who had been watching him had gone to cover. He
had little fear, though he carried no weapon. He was supremely
confident in his own strength and science.</p>

<p>Black, following him in, shut the door behind him. Frank heard
the snick of a bolt being shot into its socket in the dark. Black
switched on the light.</p>

<p>"We're playing fair, Constable Fellowe." he said, with an
amiable smile. "You see, we do not try any monkey tricks with
you. Everything is straight and above-board."</p>

<p>He led the way up the thickly-carpeted stairs, and Frank
followed. The young man noticed the house was luxuriously
furnished. Rich engravings hung on the walls, the curtains that
veiled the big stairway window were of silk, cabinets of Chinese
porcelain filled the recesses.</p>

<p>Black led the way to a room on the first floor. It was not the
room in which the board meeting had been held, but a small one
which led off from the board-room. Here the luxury was less
apparent. Two desks formed the sole furniture of the room; the
carpet under foot was of the commonplace type to be found in the
average office. A great panel of tapestry&mdash;the one touch of
luxury&mdash;covered one wall, and a cluster of lights in the
ceiling afforded light to the room. A little fire was burning in
the grate. On a small table near one of the desks supper had been
laid for two. Frank noticed this, and Black, inwardly cursing his
own stupidity, smiled.</p>

<p>"It looks as though I expected you," he said easily, "though,
as a matter of fact, I have some friends here to-night, and one
of them is staying to supper."</p>

<p>Frank nodded. He knew the significance of that supper-table
and the white paper pads ready for use.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Black, and himself sat at one of the desks.
Frank seated himself slowly at some distance from the other, half
turning to face the man whom he had set himself to ruin.</p>

<p>"Now, let us get to business," said Black briskly. "There is
no reason in the world why you and I should not have an
understanding. I'm a business man, you're a business man, and a
smart young man too." he said approvingly.</p>

<p>Frank made no reply. He knew what was coming.</p>

<p>"Now suppose," Black continued reflectively, "suppose we make
an arrangement like this. You imagine that I am engaged in a most
obnoxious type of business. Oh, I know!" he went on
deprecatingly, "I know! You're under the impression that I'm
making huge profits, that I'm robbing people by bucket-shop
methods. I needn't tell you, constable, that I am most grieved
and indignant that you should have entertained so low an opinion
of my character."</p>

<p>His voice was neither grieved nor indignant. Indeed, the tone
he employed was a cheerful admission of fault.</p>

<p>"Now, I am quite content you should investigate my affairs
first hand. You know we receive a large number of accounts from
all over the Continent and that we pay away enormous sums to
clients who&mdash;well, shall we say&mdash;gamble on
margins?"</p>

<p>"You can say what you like," said Frank.</p>

<p>"Now," said Black, "suppose you go to Paris, constable, you
can easily get leave, or go into the provinces, to any of the big
towns in Great Britain where our clients reside, and interview
them for yourself as to our honesty. Question them&mdash;I'll
give you a list of them. I don't want you to do this at your own
expense "&mdash;his big hands were outstretched in protest. "I
don't suppose you have plenty of money to waste on that variety
of excursion. Now, I will hand you to-night, if you like, a
couple of hundred pounds, and you shall use this just as you like
to further your investigations. How does that strike you?"</p>

<p>Frank smiled. "It strikes me as devilish ingenious," he said.
"I take the couple of hundred, and I can either use it for the
purpose you mention or I can put it to my own account, and no
questions will be asked. Do I understand aright?"</p>

<p>Colonel Black smiled and nodded. His strong, yellow face
puckered in internal amusement. "You are a singularly sharp young
man," he said.</p>

<p>Frank rose. "There's nothing doing." he said.</p>

<p>Colonel Black frowned. "You mean you refuse?" he said.</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "I refuse," he said, "absolutely. You can't
bribe me with two hundred pounds, or with two thousand pounds,
Black. I am not to be bought. I believe you are one of the most
dangerous people society knows. I believe that both here and in
the City you are running on crooked lines; I shall not rest until
I have you in prison."</p>

<p>Black rose slowly to his feet. "So that's it, is it?" he said.
There was menace and malignity in his tones. A look of implacable
hatred met Fellowe's steady gaze. "You will regret this," he went
on gratingly. "I have given you a chance that most young men
would jump at. I could make that three hundred&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you were to make it thirty-three hundred, or thirty-three
thousand," said Frank impatiently, "there would be no business
done. I know you too well, Black. I know more about you than you
think I know."</p>

<p>He took up his hat and examined the interior thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"There is a man wanted in France&mdash;an ingenious man who
initiated Get-rich-quick banks all over the country, particularly
in Lyons and the South&mdash;his name is Olloroff," he said
carefully. "There's quite a big reward offered for him He had a
partner who died suddenly&mdash;"</p>

<p>Black's face went white. The hand that rose to his lips shook
a little. "You know too much, I think," he said. He turned
swiftly and left the room. Frank sprang back to the door. He
suspected treachery, but before he could reach it the door closed
with a click. He turned the handle and pulled, but it was
fast.</p>

<p>He looked round the room, and saw another door at the farther
end. He was half-way towards this when all the lights in the room
went out. He was in complete darkness. What he had thought to be
a window at one end turned out to be a blank wall, so cunningly
draped with curtains and ingeniously-shaped blinds as to delude
the observer. The real window, which looked out on to the street
below, was heavily shuttered.</p>

<p>The absence of light was no inconvenience to him. He had a
small electric lamp in his pocket, which he flashed round the
room. It had been a tactical error on his part to put Black on
his guard, but the temptation to give the big man a fright had
been too great. He realized that he was in a position of
considerable danger. Save the young man he had seen in the
street, and who in such an extraordinary manner had recognized
him, nobody knew of his presence in that house.</p>

<p>He made a swift search of the room and listened intently at
both doors, but he could hear nothing. On the landing outside the
door through which he had entered there were a number of antique
Eastern arms hung on the wall. He had a slight hope that this
scheme of decoration might have been continued in the room, but
before he began his search he knew his quest was hopeless. There
would be no weapons here. He made a careful examination of the
floor; he wanted to be on his guard against traps and
pitfalls.</p>

<p>There was no danger from this. He sat down on the edge of a
desk and waited. He waited half an hour before the enemy gave a
sign. Then, close to his ear, it seemed, a voice asked "Are you
going to be sensible, constable?"</p>

<p>Frank flashed the rays of his lamp in the direction from which
the voice came. He saw what appeared to him to be a hanging
Eastern lantern. He had already observed that the stem from which
it hung was unusually thick; now he realized that the bell-shaped
lamp was the end of a speaking-tube. He guessed, and probably
correctly, that the device had been hung rather to allow Black to
overhear than for the purpose of communicating with the occupants
of the room.</p>

<p>He made no reply. Again the question was repeated, and he
raised his head and answered. "Come and see," he challenged.</p>

<p>All the time he had been waiting in the darkness his attention
had been divided between the two doors. He was on the alert for
the thin pencil of light which would show him the stealthy
opening. In some extraordinary manner he omitted to take into
consideration the possibility of the outside lights being
extinguished.</p>

<p>He was walking up and down the carpeted centre of the room,
which was free of any impediment, when a slight noise behind him
arrested his attention. He had half turned when a noose was
slipped over his body, a pair of desperate arms encircled his
legs, and he was thrown violently to the floor. He struggled, but
it was against uneven odds. The lasso which had pinioned him
prevented the free use of his arms. He found himself lying face
downwards upon the carpet. A handkerchief was thrust into his
mouth, something cold and hard encircled his wrists and pulled
them together. He heard a click, and knew that he was handcuffed
behind.</p>

<p>"Pull him up," said Black's voice.</p>

<p>At that moment the lights in the room went on. Frank staggered
to his feet, assisted ungently by Jakobs. Black was there. Sparks
was there, and a stranger Frank had seen enter the house was also
there, but a silk handkerchief was fastened over the lower half
of his face, and all that Frank could see was the upper half of a
florid countenance and a pair of light blue eyes that twinkled
shiftily.</p>

<p>"Put him on that sofa," said Black. "Now," he said, when his
prisoner had been placed according to instructions, "I think you
are going to listen to reason."</p>

<p>It was impossible for Frank Fellowe to reply. The handkerchief
in his mouth was an effective bar to any retort that might have
risen in his mind, but his eyes, clear, unwavering, spoke in
unmistakable language to the smiling man who faced him.</p>

<p>"My proposition is very simple," said Black: "you're to hold
your tongue, mind your own business, accept a couple of hundred
on account, and you will not be further molested. Refuse, and I'm
going to put you where I can think about you." He smiled
crookedly. "There are some five cellars in this house," said
Black; "if you are a student of history, as I am, Mr. Fellowe,
you should read the History of the Rhine Barons. You would
recognize then that I have an excellent substitute for the donjon
keeps of old. You will be chained there by the legs, you will be
fed according to the whims of a trusted custodian, who, I may
tell you, is a very absent-minded man, and there you will remain
until you are either mad or glad&mdash;glad to accept our
terms&mdash;or mad enough to be incarcerated in some convenient
asylum, where nobody will take your accusations very
seriously."</p>

<p>Black turned his head. "Take that gag out," he said; "we will
bring him into the other room. I do not think that his voice will
be heard, however loudly he shouts, in there."</p>

<p>Jakobs pulled the handkerchief roughly from Frank's mouth. He
was half pushed, half led, to the door of the board-room, which
was in darkness. Black went ahead and fumbled for the switch, the
others standing in the doorway. He found the light at last, and
then he stepped back with a cry of horror.</p>

<p>Well he might, for four strangers sat at the board&mdash;four
masked men. The door leading into the board-room was a wide one.
The three men with their prisoner stood grouped in the centre,
petrified into immobility. The four who sat at the table uttered
no sound.</p>

<p>Black was the first to recover his self-possession. He started
forward, then stopped. His face worked, his mouth opened, but he
could frame no words. "What&mdash;what?" he gasped.</p>

<p>The masked man who sat at the head of the table turned his
bright eyes upon the proprietor of the establishment. "You did
not expect me, Mr. Olloroff?" he said bluntly.</p>

<p>"My name is Black," said the other violently. "What are you
doing here?"</p>

<p>"That you shall discover," said the masked man. "There are
seats." Then Black saw that seats had been arranged at the
farther end of the table.</p>

<p>"First of all," the masked man went on, "I will relieve you of
your prisoner. You take those handcuffs off, Sparks."</p>

<p>The man fumbled in his pocket for the key, but not in his
waistcoat pocket&mdash;his hand went farther down. "Keep your
hand up," said the man at the table, sharply. He made a little
gesture with his hand, and Black's servant saw the gleam of a
pistol. "You need have no fear," he went on, "our little business
will have no tragic sequence to-night&mdash;to-night!" he
repeated significantly. "You have had three warnings from us, and
we have come to deliver the last in person."</p>

<p>Black was fast recovering his presence of mind. "Why not
report to the police?" he scoffed.</p>

<p>"That we shall do in good time," was the polite reply, "but I
warn you personally, Black, that you have almost reached the end
of your tether."</p>

<p>In some ways Black was no coward. With an oath, he whipped out
a revolver and sprang into the room. As he did so the room went
dark, and Frank found himself seized by a pair of strong hands
and wrenched from the loose grip of his captor. He was pushed
forward, a door slammed behind him. He found himself tumbling
down the carpeted stairs into the hall below. Quick hands removed
the handcuffs from his wrists, the street door was opened by
somebody who evidently knew the ways of the house, and he found
himself, a little bewildered, in the open street, with two men in
evening dress by his side.</p>

<p>They still wore their masks. There was nothing to distinguish
either of them from the ordinary man in the street. "This is your
way, Mr. Fellowe," said one, and he pointed up the street in the
direction of Victoria.</p>

<p>Frank hesitated. He was keen to see the end of this adventure.
Where were the other two of this vigilant four? Why had they been
left behind? What were they doing? His liberators must have
guessed his thoughts, for one of them said, "Our friends are
safe, do not trouble about them. You will oblige us, constable,
by going very quickly."</p>

<p>With a word of thanks, Frank Fellowe turned and walked quickly
up the street. He looked back once, but the two men had
disappeared into the darkness.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap05" id="chap05">V.&mdash;THE EARL OF
VERLOND</a></h2>

<p class="first">COLONEL BLACK was amused. He was annoyed, too,
and the two expressions resulted in a renewed irritation.</p>

<p>His present annoyance rose from another cause. A mysterious
tribunal, which had examined his papers, had appeared from and
disappeared to nowhere, had annoyed him&mdash;had frightened him,
if the truth be told; but courage is largely a matter of light
with certain temperaments, and strong in the security of the
morning sunshine and with the satisfaction that there was nothing
tangible for the four men to discover, he was bold enough.</p>

<p>He was sitting in his dressing-gown at breakfast, and his
companion was Sir Isaac Tramber. Colonel Black loved the good
things of life, good food and the comforts of civilization. His
breakfast was a very ample one. Sir Isaac's diet was more simple:
a brandy and water and an apple comprised the menu. "What's up?"
he growled. He had had a late night and was not in the best of
tempers.</p>

<p>Black tossed a letter across to him. "What do you think of
that?" he asked. "Here's a demand from Tangye's, the brokers, for
ten thousand pounds, and a hint that failing its arrival I shall
be posted as a defaulter."</p>

<p>"Pay it," suggested Sir Isaac languidly, and the other
laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't talk rot," he said, with offensive good humour. "Where
am I going to get ten thousand pounds? I'm nearly broke; you know
that, Tramber; we're both in the same boat. I've got two millions
on paper, but I don't think we could raise a couple of hundred
ready between us if we tried."</p>

<p>The baronet pushed back his plate. "I say," he said abruptly,
"you don't mean what you said?"</p>

<p>"About the money?"</p>

<p>"About the money&mdash;yes. You nearly gave me an attack of
heart disease. My dear chap, we should be pretty awkwardly fixed
if money dried up just now."</p>

<p>Colonel Black smiled. "That's just what has happened," he
said. "Fix or no fix, we're in it. I'm overdrawn in the bank;
I've got about a hundred pounds in the house, and I suppose
you've got another hundred."</p>

<p>"I haven't a hundred farthings," said the other.</p>

<p>"Expenses are very heavy," Black went on; "you know how these
things turn up. There are one or two in view, but beyond that we
have nothing. If we could bring about the amalgamation of those
Northern Foundries we might both sign cheques for a hundred
thousand."</p>

<p>"What about the City?"</p>

<p>The Colonel sliced off the top of his egg without replying.
Tramber knew the position in the City as well as he did.</p>

<p>"H'm," said Sir Isaac, "we've got to get money from somewhere,
Black."</p>

<p>"What about your friend?" asked Colonel Black. He spoke
carelessly, but the question was a well-considered one.</p>

<p>"Which friend?" asked Sir Isaac, with a hoarse laugh. "Not
that I have so many that you need particularize any. Do you mean
Verlond?" Black nodded. "Verlond, my dear chap," said the
baronet, "is the one man I must not go to in this world for
money."</p>

<p>"He is a very rich man," mused Black.</p>

<p>"He is a very rich man," said the other grimly, "and he may
have to leave his money to me."</p>

<p>"Isn't there an heir?" asked the colonel, interested.</p>

<p>"There was," said the baronet with a grin, "a high-spirited
nephew, who ran away from home, and is believed to have been
killed on a cattle-ranch in Texas. At any rate, Lord Verlond
intends applying to the court to presume his death."</p>

<p>"That was a blow for the old man," said Black.</p>

<p>This statement seemed to amuse Sir Isaac. He leant back in his
chair and laughed loud and long.</p>

<p>"A blow!" he said. "My dear fellow, he hated the boy worse
than poison. You see, the Verlond stock&mdash;he's a member of
the cadet branch of the family. The boy was a real Verlond.
That's why the old man hated him. I believe he made his life a
little hell. He used to have him up for week-ends to bully him,
until at last the kid got desperate, collected all his
pocket-money and ran away.</p>

<p>"Some friends of the family traced him; the old man didn't
move a step to search for him. They found work for him for a few
months in a printer's shop in London. Then he went
abroad&mdash;sailed to America on an emigrant's ticket.</p>

<p>"Some interested people took the trouble to follow his
movements. He went out to Texas and got on to a pretty bad ranch.
Later, a man after his description was shot in a street fight; it
was one of those little ranching towns that you see so
graphically portrayed in cinema palaces."</p>

<p>"Who is the heir?" asked Black.</p>

<p>"To the title, nobody. To the money, the boy's sister. She is
quite a nice girl." Black was looking at him through half-closed
eyes. The baronet curled his moustache thoughtfully and repeated,
as if to himself, "Quite a nice girl."</p>

<p>"Then you have&mdash;er&mdash;prospects?" asked Black
slowly.</p>

<p>"What the devil do you mean, Black?" asked Sir Isaac, sitting
up stiffly.</p>

<p>"Just what I say," said the other. "The man who marries the
lady gets a pretty large share of the swag. That's the position,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Something like that," said Sir Isaac sullenly.</p>

<p>The colonel got up and folded his napkin carefully. Colonel
Black needed ready money so badly that it mattered very little
what the City said. If Sandford objected that would be another
matter, but Sandford was a good sportsman, though somewhat
difficult to manage. He stood for a moment looking down on the
baronet thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Ikey," he said, "I have noticed in you of late a disposition
to look upon our mutual interests as something of which a man
might be ashamed&mdash;I have struck an unexpected streak of
virtue in you, and I confess that I am a little distressed."</p>

<p>His keen eyes were fixed on the other steadily.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's nothing," said the baronet uneasily, "but the fact
is, I've got to keep my end up in society."</p>

<p>"You owe me a little," began Black.</p>

<p>"Four thousand," said the other promptly, "and it is secured
by a £50,000 policy on my life."</p>

<p>"The premiums of which I pay," snarled the colonel grimly;
"but I wasn't thinking of money."</p>

<p>His absorbed gaze took in the baronet from head to foot.</p>

<p>"Fifty thousand pounds!" he said facetiously. "My dear Ikey,
you're worth much more murdered than alive."</p>

<p>The baronet shivered. "Don't make those rotten jokes," he
said, and finished his brandy at a gulp.</p>

<p>The other nodded. "I'll leave you to your letters." he
said.</p>

<p>Colonel Black was a remarkably methodical and neat personage.
Wrapped in his elaborate dressing-gown, he made his way through
the flat and, reaching his study alone, he closed the door behind
him and let it click.</p>

<p>He was disturbed in his mind at this sudden assumption of
virtue on the part of his confederate; it was more than
disconcerting, it was alarming. Black had no illusions. He did
not trust Sir Isaac Tramber any more than he did other men.</p>

<p>It was Black's money that had, to some extent, rehabilitated
the baronet in society; it was Black's money that had purchased
racehorses and paid training bills. Here again, the man was
actuated by no altruistic desire to serve one against whom the
doors of society were shut and the hands of decent men were
turned.</p>

<p>An outcast, Sir Isaac Tramber was of no value to the colonel:
he had even, on one occasion, summarized his relationship with
the baronet in a memorable and epigrammatic sentence: "He was the
most dilapidated property I have ever handled; but I refurnished
him, redecorated him, and today, even if he is not beautiful, he
is very letable."</p>

<p>And very serviceable Sir Isaac had proved&mdash;well worth the
money spent on him, well worth the share he received from the
proceeds of that business he professed to despise.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Tramber feared Black. That was half the secret of
the power which the stronger man wielded over him. When at times
he sought to escape from the tyranny his partner had established,
there were sleepless nights. During the past few weeks something
had happened which made it imperative that he should dissociate
himself from the confederacy; that "something" had to do with the
brightening of his prospects.</p>

<p>Lady Mary Cassilirs was more of a reality now than she had
ever been. With Lady Mary went that which Black in his vulgar way
described as "swag."</p>

<p>The old earl had given him to understand that his addresses
would not be unwelcome. Lady Mary was his ward, and perhaps it
was because she refused to be terrorized by the wayward old man
and his fits of savage moroseness, and because she treated his
terrible storms of anger as though they did not exist and never
had existed, that in the grim old man's hard and apparently
wicked heart there had kindled a flame of respect for her.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac went back to his own chambers in a thoughtful frame
of mind. He would have to cut Black, and his conscience had
advanced so few demands on his actions that he felt justified in
making an exception in this case.</p>

<p>He felt almost virtuous as he emerged again, dressed for the
park, and he was in his brightest mood when he met Lord Verlond
and his beautiful ward.</p>

<p>There were rude people who never referred to the Earl of
Verlond and his niece except as "Beauty and the Beast." She was a
tall girl and typically English&mdash;straight of back, clear of
skin, and bright of eye. A great mass of chestnut hair, two
arched eyebrows, and a resolute little chin made up a face of
special attractiveness. She stood almost head and shoulders above
the old man at her side. Verlond had never been a beauty. Age had
made his harsh lines still harsher; there was not a line in his
face which did not seem as though it had been carved from solid
granite, so fixed, so immovable and cold it was.</p>

<p>His lower jaw protruded, his eyes were deep set. He gave you
the uncanny impression when you first met him that you had been
longer acquainted with his jaw than with his eyes.</p>

<p>He snapped a greeting to Sir Isaac. "Sit down, Ikey," he
smiled. The girl had given the baronet the slightest of nods, and
immediately turned her attention to the passing throng.</p>

<p>"Not riding to-day?" asked Sir Isaac.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the peer, "I am at this moment mounted on a grey
charger, leading a brigade of cavalry."</p>

<p>His humour took this one form, and supplied answers to
unnecessary questions. Then suddenly his face went sour, and
after a glance round to see whether the girl's attention had been
attracted elsewhere, he leant over towards Sir Isaac and,
dropping his voice, said, "Ikey, you're going to have some
difficulty with her."</p>

<p>"I am used to difficulties," said Sir Isaac airily.</p>

<p>"Not difficulties like this," said the earl. "Don't be a fool,
Ikey, don't pretend you're clever. I know&mdash;the
difficulties&mdash;I have to live in the same house with her.
She's an obstinate devil&mdash;there's no other word for it."</p>

<p>Sir Isaac looked round cautiously. "Is there anybody else?" he
asked.</p>

<p>He saw the earl's brows tighten, his eyes were glaring past
him, and, following their direction, Sir Isaac saw the figure of
a young man coming towards them with a smile that illuminated the
whole of his face.</p>

<p>That smile was directed neither to the earl nor to his
companion; it was unmistakably intended for the girl, who, with
parted lips and a new light in her eyes, beckoned the new-comer
forward.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac scowled horribly. "The accursed cheek of the
fellow," he muttered angrily.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Horace Gresham to the earl; "taking the
air?"</p>

<p>"No," growled the old man, "I am bathing, I am deep-sea
fishing, I am aeroplaning. Can't you see what I am doing? I'm
sitting here&mdash;at the mercy of every jackass that comes along
to address his insane questions to me."</p>

<p>Horace laughed. He was genuinely amused. There was just this
touch of perverse humour in the old man which saved him from
being absolutely repulsive. Without further ceremony he turned to
the girl. "I expected to find you here," he said.</p>

<p>"How is that great horse of yours?" she asked. He shot a
smiling glance at Tramber.</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll be fit enough on the day of the race," he said. "We
shall make Timbolino gallop."</p>

<p>"Mine will beat yours, wherever they finish, for a thousand,"
said Sir Isaac angrily.</p>

<p>"I should not like to take your money," said the young man. "I
feel that it would be unfair to you, and unfair to&mdash;your
friend."</p>

<p>The last words were said carelessly, but Sir Isaac Tramber
recognized the undertone of hostility, and read in the little
pause which preceded them the suggestion that this cheery young
man knew much more about his affairs than he was prepared for the
moment to divulge.</p>

<p>"I am not concerned about my friend," said the baronet
angrily. "I merely made a fair and square sporting offer. Of
course, if you do not like to accept it&mdash;" He shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh, I would accept it all right," said the other. He turned
deliberately to the girl.</p>

<p>"What's Gresham getting at?" asked Verlond, with a grin at his
friend's discomfiture.</p>

<p>"I didn't know he was a friend of yours," said Sir Isaac;
"where did you pick him up?"</p>

<p>Lord Verlond showed his yellow teeth in a grin. "Where one
picks up most of one's undesirable acquaintances," he said, "in
the members' enclosure. But racing is getting so damned
respectable, Ikey, that a real top-notch undesirable is hard to
meet. The last race-meeting I went to, what do you think I found?
The tea-room crammed, you couldn't get in at the doors; the bar
empty. Racing is going to the dogs, Ikey."</p>

<p>He was on his favourite hobby now, and Sir Isaac shifted
uneasily, for the old man was difficult to divert when in the
mood for reminiscent chatter.</p>

<p>"You can't bet nowadays like you used to bet," the earl went
on. "I once backed a horse for five thousand pounds at 20-1,
without altering the price. Where could you do that
nowadays?"</p>

<p>"Let us walk about a little," said the girl.</p>

<p>Lord Verlond was so engrossed in his grievance against racing
society that he did not observe the two young people rise and
stroll away.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac saw them, and would have interrupted the other's
garrulity, but for the wholesome fear he had of the old man's
savage temper.</p>

<p>"I can't understand," said Horace, "how your uncle can stick
that bounder."</p>

<p>The girl smiled. "Oh, he can 'stick' him all right," she said
dryly. "Uncle's patience with unpleasant people is
proverbial."</p>

<p>"He's not very patient with me," said Mr. Horace Gresham.</p>

<p>She laughed. "That is because you are not sufficiently
unpleasant," she said. "You have to be hateful to everybody else
in the world before uncle likes you."</p>

<p>"And I'm not that, am I?" he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>She flushed a little. "No, I wouldn't say you were that," she
said, glancing at him from under her eyelashes. "I am sure you
are a very nice and amiable young man. You must have lots of
friends. Ikey, on the other hand, has such queer friends. We saw
him at the Blitz the other day, lunching with a perfectly
impossible man&mdash;do you know him?" she asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I don't know any perfectly impossible
persons," he said promptly.</p>

<p>"A Colonel Black?" she suggested.</p>

<p>He nodded. "I know of him," he replied.</p>

<p>"Who is this Black?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He is a colonel."</p>

<p>"In the army?"</p>

<p>"Not in our army," said Horace with a smile. "He is what they
call in America a 'pipe colonel,' and he's&mdash;well, he's a
friend of Sir Isaac&mdash;" he began, and hesitated.</p>

<p>"That doesn't tell me very much, except that he can't be very
nice," she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her eagerly. "I'm so glad you said that," he
said. "I was afraid&mdash;" Again he stopped, and she threw a
swift glance at him.</p>

<p>"You were afraid?" she repeated.</p>

<p>It was remarkable to see this self-possessed young man
embarrassed, as he was now. "Well," he went on, a little
incoherently, "one hears things&mdash;rumours. I know what a
scoundrel he is, and I know how sweet you are&mdash;the fact is,
Mary, I love you better than anything in life."</p>

<p>She went white and her hand trembled. She had never
anticipated such a declaration in a crowd. The unexpectedness of
it left her speechless. She looked at his face: he, too, was
pale.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't," she murmured, "at this time in the
morning."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap06" id="chap06">VI.&mdash;THE POLICEMAN AND A
LADY</a></h2>

<p class="first">FRANK FELLOWE was agitating a punch-ball in one
of the upper rooms of his little cottage, and with good
reason.</p>

<p>He was "taking out" of the ball all the grievances he had
against the petty irritants of life.</p>

<p>Sergeant Gurden had bothered him with a dozen and one forms of
petty annoyance. He had been given the least congenial of jobs;
he had been put upon melancholy point work; and he seemed to be
getting more than his share of extra duty. And, in addition, he
had the extra worry of checking, at the same time, the work of
Black's organization. He might, had he wished, put away all the
restrictions which hampered his movements, but that was not his
way. The frustration of Black's plans was one of Frank's
absorbing passions. If he had other passions which threatened to
be equally absorbing, he had the sense to check them&mdash;for a
while&mdash;</p>

<p>The daughter of a millionaire, violently introduced,
subsequently met with heart-flutterings on the one side and not a
little perturbation on the other; her gratitude and admiration
began on a wayward two-seater with defective brakes, and
progressed by way of the Zoo, for which she sent him a Sunday
ticket&mdash;for she was anxious to see just what he was
like.</p>

<p>She went in some fear of disillusionment, because an heroic
constable in uniform, whose face is neatly arranged by
helmet-peak and chin-strap, may be less heroic in clothes of his
own choosing, to say nothing of cravats and shoes.</p>

<p>But she braced herself for the humiliation of discovering that
one who could save her life could also wear a ready-made tie. She
was terribly self-conscious, kept to the unfrequented walks of
the Zoo, and was found by a very good-looking gentleman who was
dressed irreproachably in something that suggested neither the
butcher's boy at a beanfeast nor a plumber at a funeral.</p>

<p>She showed him the inmates of exactly two cages, then he took
her in hand and told her things about wild beasts that she had
never known before. He showed her the subtle distinction between
five varieties of lynx, and gave her little anecdotes of the
jungle fellowship that left her breathless with admiration.
Moreover, he took her to the most unlikely places&mdash;to rooms
where the sick and lame of the animal kingdom were nursed to
health. It would appear that there was no need to have sent him
the ticket, because he was a Fellow of the Society. There was too
much to be seen on one day.</p>

<p>She went again and yet again; rode with him over Hampstead
Heath in the early hours of the morning. She gathered that he
jobbed his horse, yet it was not always the same animal he
rode.</p>

<p>"How many horses have you in your stable?" she asked
banteringly one morning.</p>

<p>"Six," he said readily. "You see," he added hastily, "I do a
lot of hunting in the season&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, realizing that he was further in the mire.</p>

<p>"But you are a constable&mdash;a policeman!" she stammered. "I
mean&mdash;forgive me if I'm rude."</p>

<p>He turned in his saddle, and there was a twinkle in his
eye.</p>

<p>"I have a little money of my own," he said. "You see, I have
only been a constable for twelve months; previous to that
I&mdash;I wasn't a constable!"</p>

<p>He was not very lucid: by this time he was apparently
embarrassed, and she changed the subject, wondering and absurdly
pleased.</p>

<p>It was inconsistent of her to realize after the ride that
these meetings were wrong. They were wrong before, surely? Was it
worse to ride with a man who had revealed himself to be a member
of one's own class than with a policeman? Nevertheless, she knew
it was wrong and met him&mdash;and that is where Constable
Fellowe and Miss Sandford became "May" and "Frank" to one
another. There had been nothing clandestine in their
meetings.</p>

<p>Theodore Sandford, a hard-headed man, was immensely
democratic. He joked about May's policeman, made ponderous
references to stolen visits to his palatial kitchen in search of
rabbit-pie, and then there arose from a jesting nothing the
question of Frank's remaining in the force. He had admitted that
he had independent means. Why remain a ridiculous policeman? From
jest it had passed into a very serious discussion and the
presentation of an ultimatum, furiously written, furiously
posted, and as furiously regretted.</p>

<p>Theodore Sandford looked up from his writing-table with an
amused smile.</p>

<p>"So you're really angry with your policeman, are you?" he
asked.</p>

<p>But it was no joke to the girl. Her pretty face was set
determinedly.</p>

<p>"Of course," she shrugged her pretty shoulders, "Mr. Fellowe
can do as he wishes&mdash;I have no authority over
him"&mdash;this was not true&mdash;"but one is entitled to ask of
one's friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>There were tears of mortification in her eyes, and Sandford
dropped his banter. He looked at the girl searchingly, anxiously.
Her mother had died when May was a child; he was ever on the
look-out for some sign of the fell disease which carried off the
woman who had been his all.</p>

<p>"Dearest!" he said tenderly "you mustn't be worried or
bothered by your policeman; I'm sure he'd do anything in the
world for you, if he is only half a human man. You aren't looking
well," he said anxiously.</p>

<p>She smiled. "I'm tired to-night, daddy," she said, putting her
arm about his neck.</p>

<p>"You're always tired nowadays," he said. "Black thought so the
other day when he saw you. He recommended a very clever
doctor&mdash;I've got his address somewhere."</p>

<p>She shook her head with vigour. "I don't want to see doctors,"
she said decidedly.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please&mdash;please!" she pleaded, laughing now. "You
mustn't!"</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door and a footman came in. "Mr.
Fellowe, madam," he announced.</p>

<p>The girl looked round quickly. "Where is he?" she asked. Her
father saw the pink in her cheeks and shook his head
doubtingly.</p>

<p>"He is in the drawing-room," said the man.</p>

<p>"I'll go down, daddy." She turned to her father.</p>

<p>He nodded. "I think you'll find he's fairly tractable&mdash;by
the way, the man is a gentleman."</p>

<p>"A gentleman, daddy!" she answered with lofty scorn, "of
course he's a gentleman!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I mentioned it," said Mr. Theodore Sandford
humbly.</p>

<p>Frank was reading her letter&mdash;the letter which had
brought him to her&mdash;when she came in. He took her hand and
held it for a fraction of a second, then he came straight to the
point. It was hard enough, for never had she so appealed to him
as she did this night.</p>

<p>There are some women whose charms are so elusive, whose beauty
is so unordinary in character, as to baffle adequate description.
May Sandford was one of these. No one feature goes to the making
of a woman, unless, indeed, it be her mouth. There is something
in the poise of the head, in the method of arranging the hair, in
the clearness and peach-like bloom of the complexion, in the
carriage of the shoulders, the suppleness of the body, the
springy tread&mdash;each characteristic furnished something to
the beautiful whole.</p>

<p>May Sandford was a beautiful girl. She had been a beautiful
child, and had undergone none of the transition from prettiness
to plainness, from beauty to awkwardness. It was as though the
years had each contributed their quota to the creation of the
perfect woman.</p>

<p>"Surely," he said, "you do not mean this? That is not your
view?" He held out her letter. She bent her head.</p>

<p>"I think it would be best," she said in a low tone. "I don't
think we shall agree very well on&mdash;on things. You've been
rather horrid lately, Mr. Fellowe."</p>

<p>His face was very pale. "I don't remember that I have been
particularly horrid," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"It is impossible for you to remain a policeman," she went on
tremulously. She went up to him and laid her hands upon his
shoulders. "Don't you see&mdash;even papa jokes about it, and
it's horrid. I'm sure the servants talk&mdash;and I'm not a snob
really&mdash;"</p>

<p>Frank threw back his head and laughed.</p>

<p>"Can't you see, dearie, that I should not be a policeman if
there was not excellent reason? I am doing this work because I
have promised my superior that I would do it."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but," she said, bewildered, "if you left the force
you would have no superior."</p>

<p>"I cannot give up my work," he said simply. He thought a
moment, then shook his head slowly. "You ask me to break my
word," he said. "You ask me to do greater mischief than that
which I am going to undo. You wouldn't you couldn't, impose that
demand upon me."</p>

<p>She drew back a little, her head raised, pouting ever so
slightly. "I see," she said, "you would not." She held out her
hand. "I shall never ask you to make another sacrifice."</p>

<p>He took her hand, held it tightly a moment, then let it drop.
Without another word the girl left the room. Frank waited a
moment, hoping against hope that she would repent. The door
remained closed.</p>

<p>He left the house with an overwhelming sense of
depression.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap07" id="chap07">VII.&mdash;DR. ESSLEY MEETS A
MAN</a></h2>

<p class="first">DR. ESSLEY was in his study, making a very
careful microscopic examination. The room was in darkness save
for the light which came from a powerful electric lamp directed
to the reflector of the instrument. What he found on the slide
was evidently satisfactory, for by and by he removed the strip of
glass, threw it into the fire and turned on the lights.</p>

<p>He took up a newspaper cutting from the table and read it. It
interested him, for it was an account of the sudden death of Mr.
Augustus Fanks.</p>

<p>"The deceased gentleman," ran the account, "was engaged with
Colonel Black, the famous financier, discussing the details of
the new iron amalgamation, when he suddenly collapsed and, before
medical assistance could be procured, expired, it is believed, of
heart failure."</p>

<p>There had been no inquest, for Fanks had in truth a weak heart
and had been under the care of a specialist, who, since his
speciality was heart trouble, discovered symptoms of the disease
on the slightest pretext.</p>

<p>So that was the end of Fanks. The doctor nodded slowly. Yes,
that was the end of him. And now? He took a letter from his
pocket. It was addressed to him in the round sprawling
calligraphy of Theodore Sandford.</p>

<p>Essley had met him in the early days when Sandford was on
friendly terms with Black. He had been recommended to the
ironmaster by the financier, and had treated him for divers ills.
"My suburban doctor," Sandford had called him.</p>

<p>"Though I am not seeing eye to eye with our friend Black," he
wrote, "and we are for the moment at daggers drawn, I trust that
this will not affect our relationships, the more so since I wish
you to see my daughter."</p>

<p>Essley remembered having seen her once: a tall girl, with eyes
that danced with laughter and a complexion of milk and roses.</p>

<p>He put the letter in his pocket, went into his little surgery
and locked the door. When he came out he wore his long overcoat
and carried a little satchel. He had just time to catch a train
for the City, and at eleven o'clock he found himself in
Sandford's mansion.</p>

<p>"You are a weird man, doctor," said the ironmaster with a
smile, as he greeted his visitor. "Do you visit most of your
patients by night?"</p>

<p>"My aristocratic patients," said the other coolly.</p>

<p>"A bad job about poor Fanks," said the other. "He and I were
only dining together a few weeks ago. Did he tell you that he met
a man who knew you in Australia?"</p>

<p>A shadow of annoyance passed over the other's face. "Let us
talk about your daughter," he said brusquely. "What is the matter
with her?"</p>

<p>The ironmaster smiled sheepishly. "Nothing, I fear; yet you
know, Essley, she is my only child, and I sometimes imagine that
she is looking ill. My doctor in Newcastle tells me that there is
nothing wrong with her."</p>

<p>"I see," said Essley. "Where is she?"</p>

<p>"She is at the theatre," confessed the father. "You must think
I am an awful fool to bring you up to town to discuss the health
of a girl who is at the theatre, but something upset her pretty
badly last night, and I was to-day glad to see her take enough
interest in life to visit a musical comedy."</p>

<p>"Most fathers are fools," said the other. "I will wait till
she comes in." He strolled to the window and looked out. "Why
have you quarrelled with Black?" he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>The older man frowned. "Business," he said shortly. "He is
pushing me into a corner. I helped him four years ago&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He helped you, too." interrupted the doctor.</p>

<p>"But not so much as I helped him," said the other obstinately.
"I gave him his chance. He floated my company and I profited, but
he profited more. The business has now grown to such vast
proportions that it will not pay me to come in. Nothing will
alter my determination."</p>

<p>"I see." Essley whistled a little tune as he walked again to
the window.</p>

<p>Such men as this must be broken, he thought. Broken! And there
was only one way: that daughter of his. He could do nothing
to-night, that was evident&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>"I do not think I will wait for your daughter," he said.
"Perhaps I will call in tomorrow evening."</p>

<p>"I am so sorry&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the doctor silenced him. "There is no need to be sorry,"
he said with acerbity; "you will find my visit charged in my
bill."</p>

<p>The ironmaster laughed as he saw him to the door. "You are
almost as good a financier as your friend," he said.</p>

<p>"Almost," said the doctor dryly.</p>

<p>His waiting taxi dropped him at Charing Cross, and he went
straight to the nearest call-office and rang up a Temperance
Hotel at Bloomsbury. He had reasons for wishing to meet a Mr.
Weld who knew him in Australia.</p>

<p>He had no difficulty in getting the message through. Mr. Weld
was in the hotel. He waited whilst the attendant found him. By
and by a voice spoke:</p>

<p>"I am Weld&mdash;do you want me?"</p>

<p>"Yes; my name is Cole. I knew you in Australia. I have a
message for you from a mutual friend. Can you see me to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes; where?"</p>

<p>Dr. Essley had decided the place of meeting. "Outside the main
entrance of the British Museum," he said. "There are few people
about at this time of night, and I am less likely to miss
you."</p>

<p>There was a pause at the other end of the wire. "Very good,"
said the voice; in a quarter of an hour?"</p>

<p>"That will suit me admirably&mdash;good-bye."</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver. Leaving his satchel at the cloak-room
at Charing Cross Station, he set out to walk to Great Russell
Street. He would take no cab. There should be no evidence of that
description. Black would not like it. He smiled at the thought.
Great Russell Street was deserted, save for a constant stream of
taxi-cabs passing and repassing and an occasional pedestrian. He
found his man waiting; rather tall and slight, with an
intellectual, refined face.</p>

<p>"Dr. Essley?" he asked, coming forward as the other
halted.</p>

<p>"That is my&mdash;" Essley stopped. "My name is Cole," he said
harshly. "What made you think I was Essley?"</p>

<p>"Your voice," said the other calmly. "After all, it does not
matter what you call yourself; I want to see you."</p>

<p>"And I you," said Essley.</p>

<p>They walked along side by side until they came to a side
street.</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>The other laughed.</p>

<p>"I wanted to see you. You are not a bit like the Essley I
knew. He was slighter and had not your colouring, and I was
always under the impression that the Essley who went up into the
bush died."</p>

<p>"It is possible," said Essley in an absent way. He wanted to
gain time. The street was empty. A little way down there was a
gateway in which a man might lie unobserved until a policeman
came.</p>

<p>In his pocket he had an impregnated feather carefully wrapped
up in lint and oiled silk. He drew it from his pocket furtively
and with his hands behind him he stripped it of its covering.</p>

<p>"... in fact, Dr. Essley," the man was saying, "I am under the
impression that you are an impostor."</p>

<p>Essley faced him. "You think too much," he said in a low
voice, "and after all, I do not recognize&mdash;turn your face to
the light."</p>

<p>The young man obeyed. It was a moment. Quick as thought the
doctor raised the feather...</p>

<p>A hand of steel gripped his wrist. As if from the ground, two
other men had appeared. Something soft was thrust into his face;
a sickly aroma overpowered him. He struggled madly, but the odds
were too many, and then a shrill police-whistle sounded and he
dropped to the ground...</p>

<p>He awoke to find a policeman bending over him. Instinctively
he put his hand to his head.</p>

<p>"Hurt, sir?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"No." He struggled to his feet and stood unsteadily. "Did you
capture the men?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, they got away. We just spotted them as they downed
you, but, bless your heart, they seemed to be swallowed up by the
earth."</p>

<p>He looked around for the feather: it had disappeared. With
some reluctance he gave his name and address to the constable,
who called a taxi-cab.</p>

<p>"You're sure you've lost nothing, sir?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Essley testily. "Nothing&mdash;look here,
constable, do not report this." He slipped a pound into the man's
hand. "I do not wish this matter to get into the papers."</p>

<p>The constable handed the money back. "I'm sorry, sir," he
said, "I couldn't take this even if I was willing." He looked
round quickly and lowered his voice. "I've got a gentleman from
the Yard with me," he said, "one of the assistant
commissioners."</p>

<p>Essley followed the direction of the policeman's eyes. In the
shadow of the wall a man was standing.</p>

<p>"He was the chap who saw you first," said the policeman, young
and criminally loquacious.</p>

<p>Obeying some impulse he could not define, Essley walked
towards the man in the shadow.</p>

<p>"I owe you a debt of gratitude," he said. "I can only hope
that you will add to your kindness by letting the matter
drop&mdash;I should hate to see the thing referred to in the
newspapers."</p>

<p>"I suppose you would," said the unknown. He was in evening
dress, and the red glow of his cigar rather concealed than
defined his face. "But this is a matter, Dr. Essley, where you
must allow us full discretion."</p>

<p>"How do you know my name?" asked the doctor suspiciously. The
other smiled in the darkness and turned away.</p>

<p>"One moment!" Essley took a stride forward and peered into the
other's face. "I seem to recognize your voice," he said.</p>

<p>"That is possible," said the other, and pushed him gently, but
firmly, away. Essley gasped. He himself was no weakling, but this
man had an arm like steel.</p>

<p>"I think you had better go, sir," said the police-constable
anxiously. He desired neither to offend an obviously influential
member of the public nor his superior&mdash;that mysterious
commissioner who appeared and disappeared in the various
divisions and who left behind him innumerable casualties amongst
the different members of the force.</p>

<p>"I'll go," said the doctor, "but I should like to know this
gentleman's name."</p>

<p>"That cannot possibly interest you," said the stranger, and
Essley shrugged his shoulders. With that he had to be content. He
drove home to Forest Hill, thinking, thinking. Who were these
three&mdash;what object had they? Who was the man who had stood
in the shadows? Was it possible that his assailants were acting
in collusion with the police?</p>

<p>He was no nearer the solution when he reached his home. He
unlocked the door and let himself in. There was nobody in the
house but himself and the old woman upstairs. His comings and
goings were so erratic that he had organized a system which
allowed him the most perfect freedom of movement.</p>

<p>There must be an end to Dr. Essley, he decided. Essley must
disappear from London. He need not warn Black&mdash;Black would
know. He would settle the business of the iron-master and his
daughter, and then&mdash;there would be a finish.</p>

<p>He unlocked his study, entered and switched on the lights.
There was a letter on his writing-table, a letter enclosed in a
thin grey envelope. He picked it up and examined it. It had been
delivered by hand, and bore his name written in a firm hand. He
looked at the writing-table and started back. The letter had been
written in the room and blotted on the pad!</p>

<p>There was no doubt at all about it. The blotting-paper had
been placed there fresh that day, and the reverse of the bold
handwriting on the envelope was plain to see. He looked at the
envelope again.</p>

<p>It could not have been a patient: he never admitted
patients&mdash;he had none worth mentioning. The practice was a
blind. Besides, the door had been locked, and he alone had the
key. He tore the envelope open and took out the contents. It was
a half-sheet of note-paper. The three lines of writing
ran&mdash;</p>

<p>"You escaped to-night, and have only seven days to prepare
yourself for the fate which awaits you. THE FOUR JUST MEN."</p>

<p>He sank into his chair, crushed by the knowledge. They were
the Just Men&mdash;and he had escaped them. The Just Men! He
buried his face in his hands and tried to think. Seven days they
gave him. Much could be done in seven days. The terror of death
was upon him, he who had without qualm or remorse sent so many on
the long journey. But this was he&mdash;himself! He clutched at
his throat and glared round the room. Essley the
poisoner&mdash;the expert; a specialist in death&mdash;the man
who had revived the lost art of the Medicis and had hoodwinked
the law. Seven days! Well, he would settle the business of the
ironmaster. That was necessary to Black.</p>

<p>He began to make feverish preparations for the future. There
were no papers to destroy. He went into the surgery and emptied
three bottles down the sink. The fourth he would want. The fourth
had been useful to Black: a little green bottle with a glass
stopper. He slipped it into his pocket.</p>

<p>He let the tap run to wash away all trace of the drug he had
spilt. The bottles he smashed and threw into a waste-bin.</p>

<p>He went upstairs to his room, but he could not sleep. He
locked his door and put a chair against it. With a revolver in
his hand, he searched the cupboard and beneath the bed. He placed
the revolver under his pillow and tried to sleep.</p>

<p>Next morning found him haggard and ill, but none the less he
made his toilet with customary care. Punctually at noon he
presented himself at Hampstead and was shown into the
drawing-room. The girl was alone when he entered. He noted with
approval that she was very beautiful.</p>

<p>That May Sandford did not like him he knew by instinct. He saw
the cloud come to her pretty face as he came into her presence,
and was amused in his cold way.</p>

<p>"My father is out," she said.</p>

<p>"That is good," said Essley, "for now we can talk." He seated
himself without invitation.</p>

<p>"I think it is only right to tell you, Dr. Essley, that my
father's fears regarding me are quite groundless."</p>

<p>At that moment the ironmaster came in and shook hands warmly
with the doctor. "Well, how do you think she looks?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Looks tell you nothing," said the other. It was not the
moment for the feather. He had other things to do, and the
feather was not the way. He chatted for a while and then rose. "I
will send you some medicine," he said. She pulled a wry face.
"You need not worry to take it," he said, with the touch of
rancour that was one of his characteristics.</p>

<p>"Can you come to dinner on Tuesday?" asked Sandford.</p>

<p>Essley considered. This was Saturday&mdash;three days out of
seven, and anything might turn up in the meantime. "Yes," he
said, "I will come."</p>

<p>He took a cab to some chambers near the Thames Embankment. He
had a most useful room there.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap08" id="chap08">VIII.&mdash;COLONEL BLACK HAS A
SHOCK</a></h2>

<p class="first">MR. SANDFORD had an appointment with Colonel
Black. It was the final interview before the break.</p>

<p>The City was busy with rumours. A whisper had circulated; all
was not well with the financier&mdash;the amalgamation on which
so much depended had not gone through. Black sat at his desk that
afternoon, idly twiddling a paper-knife. He was more sallow than
usual; the hand that held the knife twitched nervously. He looked
at his watch. It was time Sandford came. He pushed a bell by the
side of his desk and a clerk appeared.</p>

<p>"Has Mr. Sandford arrived?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He has just come, sir," said the man.</p>

<p>"Show him in."</p>

<p>The two men exchanged formal greetings, and Black pointed to a
chair. "Sit down, Sandford," he said curtly. "Now, exactly how do
we stand?"</p>

<p>"Where we did," said the other uncompromisingly.</p>

<p>"You will not come into my scheme?"</p>

<p>"I will not," said the other.</p>

<p>Colonel Black tapped the desk with his knife, and Sandford
looked at him. He seemed older than when he had last seen him.
His yellow face was seamed and lined.</p>

<p>"It means ruin for me," he said suddenly. "I have more
creditors than I can count. If the amalgamation went through I
should be established. There are lots of people in with me
too&mdash;Ikey Tramber&mdash;you know Sir Isaac? He's a friend
of&mdash;er&mdash;the Earl of Verlond."</p>

<p>But the elder man was not impressed. "It is your fault if
you're in a hole," said he. "You have taken on too big a
job&mdash;more than that, you have taken too much for
granted."</p>

<p>The man at the desk looked up from under his straight brows.
"It is all very well for you to sit there and tell me what I
should do," he said, and the shakiness of his voice told the
other something of the passion he concealed. "I do not want
advice or homily&mdash;I want money. Come into my scheme and
amalgamate, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or&mdash;" repeated the ironmaster quietly.</p>

<p>"I do not threaten you," said Black sullenly; "I warn you. You
are risking more than you know."</p>

<p>"I'll take the risk," said Sandford. He got up on to his feet.
"Have you anything more to say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Then I'll bid you good-bye."</p>

<p>The door closed with a slam behind him, and Black did not
move. He sat there until it was dark, doing no more than scribble
aimlessly upon his blotting-pad. It was nearly dark when he drove
back to the flat he occupied in Victoria Street and let himself
in.</p>

<p>"There is a gentleman waiting to see you, sir," said the man
who came hurrying to help him out of his coat.</p>

<p>"What sort of a man?"</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly, sir, but I have got a feeling that he
is a detective."</p>

<p>"A detective?" He found his hands trembling, and cursed his
folly. He stood uncertainly in the centre of the hall. In a
minute he had mastered his fears and turned the handle of the
door.</p>

<p>A man rose to meet him. He had a feeling that he had met him
before. It was one of those impressions that it is so difficult
to explain. "You wanted to see me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the man, a note of deference in his voice. "I
have called to make a few inquiries."</p>

<p>It was on the tip of Black's tongue to ask him whether he was
a police officer, but somehow he had not the courage to frame the
words. The effort was unnecessary, as it proved, for the next
words of the man explained his errand.</p>

<p>"I have been engaged," he said, "by a firm of solicitors to
discover the whereabouts of Dr. Essley."</p>

<p>Black looked hard at him. "There ought to be no difficulty,"
he said, "in that. The doctor's name is in the Directory."</p>

<p>"That is so," said the man, "and yet I have had the greatest
difficulty in running him to earth. As a matter of fact,"
explained the man, "I was wrong when I said I wanted to discover
his whereabouts. It is his identity I wish to establish."</p>

<p>"I do not follow you," said the financier.</p>

<p>"Well," said the man, "I don't know exactly how to put it. If
you know Dr. Essley, you will recall the fact that he was for
some years in Australia."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Black. "He and I came back together."</p>

<p>"And you were there some years, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we were there for a number of years, though we were not
together all the time."</p>

<p>"I see," said the man. "You went out together, I believe?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the other sharply, "we went at different
periods."</p>

<p>"Have you seen him recently?"</p>

<p>"No, I have not seen him, although I have frequently written
to him on various matters." Black was trying hard not to lose his
patience. It would not do for this man to see how much the
questions were irritating him.</p>

<p>The man jotted down something in his notebook, closed it and
put it in his pocket. "Would you be surprised to learn," he asked
quietly, "that the real Dr. Essley who went out to Australia died
there?"</p>

<p>Black's fingers caught the edge of the table and he steadied
himself.</p>

<p>"I did not know that," he said. "Is that all you have to ask?"
he said, as the man finished.</p>

<p>"I think that will do, sir," said the detective.</p>

<p>"Can I ask you on whose behalf you are inquiring?" demanded
the colonel.</p>

<p>"That I am not at liberty to tell."</p>

<p>After he had gone, Black paced the apartment, deep in
thought.</p>

<p>He took down from the shelf a continental Baedeker and worked
out with a pencil and paper a line of retirement. The refusal of
Sandford to negotiate with him was the crowning calamity.</p>

<p>He crossed the room to the safe which stood in the corner, and
opened it. In the inside drawer were three flat packets of notes.
He picked them out and laid them on the table. They were notes on
the Bank of France, each for a thousand francs.</p>

<p>It would be well to take no risks. He put them in the inside
pocket of his coat. If all things failed, they were the way to
freedom. As for Essley&mdash;he smiled. He must go any way. He
left his flat and drove eastwards to the City. Two men followed
him, though this he did not know.</p>

<p>Black boasted that his corporation kept no books, maintained
no record, and this fact was emphasized the night that the Four
had visited him unbidden. Their systematic search for evidence,
which they had intended to use against him at a recognized
tribunal, had failed to disclose the slightest vestige of
documentary evidence which might be employed. Yet, if the truth
be told, Black kept a very complete set of books, only they were
in a code of his own devising, the key of which he had never put
on paper, and which he only could understand.</p>

<p>He was engaged on the evening of the detective's visit in
placing even these ledgers beyond the reach of the Four. He had
good reason for his uneasiness. The Four had been very active of
late, and they had thought fit to issue another challenge to
Colonel Black. He was busy from nine o'clock to eleven, tearing
up apparently innocent letters and burning them. When that hour
struck, he looked at his watch and confirmed the time. He had
very important business that night.</p>

<p>He wrote a note to Sir Isaac Tramber, asking him to meet him
that night. He had need of every friend, every pull, and every
bit of help that could come to him.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap09" id="chap09">IX.&mdash;LORD VERLOND GIVES A
DINNER</a></h2>

<p class="first">LORD VERLOND was an afternoon visitor at the
Sandford establishment. He had come for many reasons, not the
least of which nobody expected. He was a large shareholder in the
Sandford Foundries, and with rumours of amalgamation in the air
there was excuse enough for his visit. Doubly so, it seemed, when
the first person he met was a large, yellow-faced man,
confoundedly genial (in the worst sense of the word) and too
ready to fraternize for the old man's liking.</p>

<p>"I have heard of you, my lord," said Colonel Black.</p>

<p>"For the love of Heaven, don't call me 'my lord'!" snapped the
earl. "Man alive, you are asking me to be rude to you!"</p>

<p>But no man of Verlond's standing could be rude to the colonel,
with his mechanical smile and his beaming eye.</p>

<p>"I know a friend of yours, I think," he said, in that soothing
tone which in a certain type of mind passes for deference.</p>

<p>"You know Ikey Tramber, which is not the same thing," said the
earl.</p>

<p>Colonel Black made a noise indicating his amusement. "He
always&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"He always speaks well of me and says what a fine fellow I am,
and how the earth loses its savour if he passes a day without
seeing me," assisted Lord Verlond, his eyes alight with pleasant
malice, "and he tells you what a good sportsman I am, and what a
true and kindly heart beats behind my somewhat unprepossessing
exterior, and how if people only knew me they would love
me&mdash;he says all this, doesn't he?"</p>

<p>Colonel Black bowed.</p>

<p>"I don't think!" said Lord Verlond vulgarly. He looked at the
other for a while. "You shall come to dinner with me to-night
&mdash;you will meet a lot of people who will dislike you
intensely."</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted," murmured the colonel.</p>

<p>He was hoping that in the conference which he guessed would be
held between Sandford and his lordship he would be invited to
participate. In this, however, he was disappointed. He might have
taken his leave there and then, but he chose to stay and discuss
art (which he imperfectly understood) with a young and distracted
lady who was thinking about something else all the time.</p>

<p>She badly wanted to bring the conversation round to the
Metropolitan police force, in the hope that a rising young
constable might be mentioned. She would have asked after him, but
her pride prevented her. Colonel Black himself did not broach the
subject.</p>

<p>He was still discussing lost pictures when Lord Verlond
emerged from the study with Sandford. "Let your daughter come,"
the earl was saying.</p>

<p>Sandford was undecided. "I'm greatly obliged&mdash;I should
not like her to go alone."</p>

<p>Something leapt inside Colonel Black's bosom. A chance...!</p>

<p>"If you are talking of the dinner to-night," he said with an
assumption of carelessness, "I shall be happy to call in my car
for you."</p>

<p>Still Sandford was not easy in his mind. It was May who should
make the decision.</p>

<p>"I think I'd like to, daddy," she said.</p>

<p>She did not greatly enjoy the prospect of going anywhere with
the colonel, but it would only be a short journey.</p>

<p>"If I could stand in loco parentis to the young lady," said
Black, nearly jocular, "I should esteem it an honour."</p>

<p>He looked round and caught a curious glint in Lord Verlond's
eyes. The earl was watching him closely, eagerly almost, and a
sudden and unaccountable fear gripped the financier's heart.</p>

<p>"Excellent, excellent!" murmured the old man, still watching
him through lowered lids. "It isn't far to go, and I think you'll
stand the journey well."</p>

<p>The girl smiled, but the grim fixed look on the earl's face
did not relax.</p>

<p>"As you are an invalid, young lady," he went on, despite May's
laughing protest&mdash;"as you're an invalid, young lady, I will
have Sir James Bower and Sir Thomas Bigland to meet you&mdash;you
know those eminent physicians, colonel? Your Dr. Essley will, at
any rate&mdash;experts both on the action of vegetable
alkaloids."</p>

<p>Great beads of sweat stood on Black's face, but his features
were under perfect control. Fear and rage glowed in his eyes, but
he met the other's gaze defiantly. He smiled even&mdash;a slow,
laboured smile. "That puts an end to any objection," he said
almost gaily.</p>

<p>The old man took his leave and was grinning to himself all the
way back to town.</p>

<p>The Earl of Verlond was a stickler for punctuality: a grim,
bent old man, with a face that, so Society said, told eloquently
the story of his life, his bitter tongue was sufficient to
maintain for him the respect&mdash;or if not the respect, the
fear that so ably substitutes respect&mdash;of his friends.</p>

<p>"Friends" is a word which you would never ordinarily apply to
any of the earl's acquaintances. He had apparently no friends
save Sir Isaac Tramber. "I have people to dine with me," he had
said cynically when this question of friendship was once
discussed by one who knew him sufficiently well to deal with so
intimate a subject.</p>

<p>That night he was waiting in the big library of Carnarvon
Place. The earl was one of those men who observed a rigid
time-table every day of his life. He glanced at his watch; in two
minutes he would be on his way to the drawing-room to receive his
guests.</p>

<p>Horace Gresham was coming. A curious invitation, Sir Isaac
Tramber had thought, and had ventured to remark as much,
presuming his friendship.</p>

<p>"When I want your advice as to my invitation list, Ikey," said
the earl, "I will send you a prepaid telegram."</p>

<p>"I thought you hated him," grumbled Sir Isaac.</p>

<p>"Hate him! Of course I hate him. I hate everybody. I should
hate you, but you are such an insignificant devil," said the
earl. "Have you made your peace with Mary?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean by 'making my peace'," said Sir
Isaac complainingly. "I tried to be amiable to her, and I only
seemed to succeed in making a fool of myself."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the nobleman with a little chuckle, "she would like
you best natural."</p>

<p>Sir Isaac shot a scowling glance at his patron. "I suppose you
know," he said, "that I want to marry Mary."</p>

<p>"I know that you want some money without working for it," said
the earl. "You have told me about it twice. I am not likely to
forget it. It is the sort of thing I think about at nights."</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't pull my leg," growled the baronet. "Are
you waiting for any other guests?"</p>

<p>"No," snarled the earl, "I am sitting on the top of Mont Blanc
eating rice pudding." There was no retort to this. "I've invited
quite an old friend of yours," said the earl suddenly, "but it
doesn't look as if he was turning up."</p>

<p>Ikey frowned. "Old friend?"</p>

<p>The other nodded. "Military gent," he said laconically. "A
colonel in the army, though nobody knows the army."</p>

<p>Sir Isaac's jaw dropped. "Not Black?"</p>

<p>Lord Verlond nodded. He nodded several times, like a gleeful
child confessing a fault of which it was inordinately proud.
"Black it is," he said, but made no mention of the girl.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch again and pulled a little face. "Stay
here," he commanded. "I'm going to telephone."</p>

<p>"Can I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can't!" snapped the earl. He was gone some time, and when
he returned to the library there was a smile on his face. "Your
pal's not coming," he said, and offered no explanation either for
the inexplicable behaviour of the colonel or for his
amusement.</p>

<p>At dinner Horace Gresham found himself seated next to the most
lovely woman in the world. She was also the kindest and the
easiest to amuse. He was content to forget the world, and such of
the world who were gathered about the earl, but Lord Verlond had
other views.</p>

<p>"Met a friend of yours to-day," he said abruptly and
addressing Horace.</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir?" The young man was politely interested.</p>

<p>"Sandford&mdash;that terribly prosperous gentleman from
Newcastle." Horace nodded cautiously. "Friend of yours too, ain't
he?" The old man turned swiftly to Sir Isaac. "I asked his
daughter to come to dinner&mdash;father couldn't come. She ain't
here."</p>

<p>He glared round the table for the absent girl.</p>

<p>"In a sense Sandford is a friend of mine," said Sir Isaac no
less cautiously, since he must make a statement in public without
exactly knowing how the elder man felt on the subject of the
absent guests; "at least, he's a friend of a friend."</p>

<p>"Black," snarled Lord Verlond, "bucket-shop swindler&mdash;are
you in it?"</p>

<p>"I have practically severed my connection with him," Sir Isaac
hastened to say.</p>

<p>Verlond grinned. "That means he's broke," he said, and turned
to Horace. "Sandford's full of praise for a policeman who's mad
keen on his girl&mdash;friend of yours?"</p>

<p>Horace nodded. "He's a great friend of mine," he said
quietly.</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's a policeman," said Horace.</p>

<p>"And I suppose he's got two legs and a head and a pair of
arms," said the earl. "You're too full of information&mdash;I
know he's a policeman. Everybody seems to be talking about him.
Now, what does he do, where does he come from&mdash;what the
devil does it all mean?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't give you any information," said Horace.
"The only thing that I am absolutely certain about in my own mind
is that he is a gentleman."</p>

<p>"A gentleman and a policeman?" asked the earl incredulously.
Horace nodded. "A new profession for the younger son, eh?"
remarked Lord Verlond sardonically. "No more running away and
joining the army; no more serving before the mast; no more
cow-punching on the pampas&mdash;"</p>

<p>A look of pain came into Lady Mary's eyes. The old lord swung
round on her.</p>

<p>"Sorry" he growled. "I wasn't thinking of that young fool. No
more dashing away to the ends of the earth for the younger son;
no dying picturesquely in the Cape Mounted Rifles, or turning up
at an appropriate hour with a bag of bullion under each arm to
save the family from ruin. Join the police force, that's the
game. You ought to write a novel about that: a man who can write
letters to the sporting papers can write anything."</p>

<p>"By the way," he added, "I am coming down to Lincoln on
Tuesday to see that horse of yours lose."</p>

<p>"You will make your journey in vain," said Horace. "I have
arranged for him to win."</p>

<p>He waited later for an opportunity to say a word in private to
the old man. It did not come till the end of the dinner, when he
found himself alone with the earl. "By the way," he said, with an
assumption of carelessness, "I want to see you on urgent private
business."</p>

<p>"Want money?" asked the earl, looking at him suspiciously from
underneath his shaggy brows.</p>

<p>Horace smiled. "No, I don't think I am likely to borrow
money," he said.</p>

<p>"Want to marry my niece?" asked the old man with brutal
directness.</p>

<p>"That's it," said Horace coolly. He could adapt himself to the
old man's mood.</p>

<p>"Well, you can't," said the earl. "You have arranged for your
horse to win, I have arranged for her to marry Ikey. At least,"
he corrected himself, "Ikey has arranged with me."</p>

<p>"Suppose she doesn't care for this plan?" asked Horace.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose she does," said the old man with a grin. "I
can't imagine anybody liking Ikey, can you? I think he's a
hateful devil. He doesn't pay his debts, he has no sense of
honour, very little sense of decency; his associates, including
myself, are the worst men in London." He shook his head
suspiciously. "He's being virtuous now," he growled, "told me so
confidentially; informed me that he was turning over a new leaf.
What a rotten confession for a man of his calibre to make! I
mistrust him in his penitent mood." He looked up suddenly. "You
go and cut him out," he said, the tiny flame of malice, which
gave his face such an extraordinary character, shining in his
eyes. "Good idea, that! Go and cut him out; it struck me Mary was
a little keen on you. Damn Ikey! Go along!"</p>

<p>He pushed the astonished youth from him.</p>

<p>Horace found the girl in the conservatory. He was bubbling
over with joy. He had never expected to make so easy a conquest
of the old man&mdash;so easy that he almost felt frightened. It
was as if the Earl of Verlond, with that sardonic humour of his,
was devising some method of humiliating him. Impulsively he told
her all that had happened.</p>

<p>"I can't believe it," he cried, "he was so ready, so willing.
He was brutal, of course, but that was natural."</p>

<p>She looked at him with a little glint of amusement in her
eyes. "I don't think you know uncle," she said quietly.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" he stammered."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," she went on, "everybody thinks they do. They
think he's the most horrid old man in the world. Sometimes," she
confessed, "I have shared their opinion. I can never understand
why he sent poor Con away."</p>

<p>"That was your brother?" he asked.</p>

<p>She nodded. Her eyes grew moist. "Poor boy." she said softly,
"he didn't understand uncle. I didn't then. I sometimes think
uncle doesn't understand himself very well," she said with a sad
little smile. "Think of the horrid things he says about
people&mdash;think of the way he makes enemies&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And yet, I am ready to believe he is a veritable Gabriel,"
said Horace fervently. "He is a benefactor of the human race, a
king among men, the distributor of great gifts&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," she said, and laying her hand on his arm,
she led him to the farther end of the big palm court.</p>

<p>Whatever pleasure the old lord brought to Horace, it found no
counterpart in his dealings with Sir Isaac. He alternately patted
and kicked him, until the baronet was writhing with rage. The old
man seemed to take a malicious pleasure in ruffling the other.
That the views he expressed at ten o'clock that night were in
absolute contradiction to those that he had put into words at
eight o'clock on the same night did not distress him; he would
have changed them a dozen times during the course of twenty-four
hours if he could have derived any pleasure from so doing.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac was in an evil frame of mind when a servant brought
him a note. He looked round for a quiet place in which to read
it. He half suspected its origin. But why had Black missed so
splendid an opportunity of meeting Lord Verlond? The note would
explain, perhaps.</p>

<p>He crossed the room and strolled towards the conservatory,
reading the letter carefully. He read it twice, then he folded it
up and put it into his pocket; he had occasion to go to that
pocket again almost immediately, for he pulled out his watch to
see the time.</p>

<p>When he had left the little retreat on his way to the hall, he
left behind him a folded slip of paper on the floor.</p>

<p>This an exalted Horace, deliriously happy, discovered on his
way back to the card-room. He handed it to Lord Verlond who,
having no scruples, read it&mdash;and, reading it in the
seclusion of his study, grinned.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10">X.&mdash;A POLICEMAN'S
BUSINESS</a></h2>

<p class="first">THERE was living at Somers Town at that time a
little man named Jakobs.</p>

<p>He was a man of some character, albeit an unfortunate person
with "something behind him." The something behind him, however,
had come short of a lagging. "Carpets" (three months' hard
labour) almost innumerable had fallen to his share, but a lagging
had never come his way.</p>

<p>A little wizened-faced man, with sharp black eyes, very alert
in his manner, very neatly dressed, he conveyed the impression
that he was enjoying a day off, but so far as honest work was
concerned Jakobs' day was an everlasting one.</p>

<p>Mr. Jakobs had been a pensioner of Colonel Black's for some
years. During that period of time Willie Jakobs had lived the
life of a gentleman. That is to say, he lived in the manner which
he thought conformed more readily to the ideal than that which
was generally accepted by the wealthier classes.</p>

<p>There were moments when he lived like a lord&mdash;again he
had his own standard&mdash;but these periods occurred at rare
intervals, because Willie was naturally abstemious. But he
certainly lived like a gentleman, as all Somers Town agreed, for
he went to bed at whatsoever hour he chose, arose with such larks
as were abroad at the moment, or stayed in bed reading his
favourite journal.</p>

<p>A fortunate man was he, never short of a copper for a
half-pint of ale, thought no more of spending a shilling on a race
than would you or I, was even suspected of taking his breakfast
in bed, a veritable hall-mark of luxury and affluence by all
standards.</p>

<p>To him every Saturday morning came postal orders to the value
of two pounds sterling from a benefactor who asked no more than
that the recipient should be happy and forget that he ever saw a
respected dealer in stocks and shares in the act of rifling a
dead man's pockets.</p>

<p>For this William Jakobs had seen.</p>

<p>Willie was a thief, born so, and not without pride in his
skilful-fingered ancestry. He had joined the firm of Black and
Company less with the object of qualifying for a pension twenty
years hence than on the off chance of obtaining an immediate
dividend. He was guarded by the very principles which animated
the head of his firm.</p>

<p>There was an obnoxious member of the board&mdash;obnoxious to
the genial Colonel Black&mdash;who had died suddenly. A
subsequent inquisition came to the conclusion that he died from
syncope: even Willie knew no better. He had stolen quietly into
the managing director's office one day in the ordinary course of
business, for Master Jakobs stole quietly, but literally and
figuratively. He was in search of unconsidered stamps and such
loose coinage as might be found in the office of a man
notoriously careless in the matter of small change. He had
expected to find the room empty, and was momentarily paralysed to
see the great Black himself bending over the recumbent figure of
a man, busily searching the pockets of a dead man for a
letter&mdash;for the silent man on the floor had come with his
resignation in his pocket and had indiscreetly embodied in this
letter his reasons for taking the step. Greatest indiscretion of
all, he had revealed the existence of this very compromising
document to Colonel Black.</p>

<p>Willie Jakobs knew nothing about the letter&mdash;had no
subtle explanation for the disordered pocket-book. To his
primitive mind Colonel Black was making a search for money: it
was, in fact, a stamp-hunt on a large scale, and in his agitation
he blurted this belief.</p>

<p>At the subsequent inquest Mr. Jakobs did not give evidence.
Officially he knew nothing concerning the matter. Instead he
retired to his home in Somers Town, a life pensioner subject to a
continuation of his reticence. Two years later, one Christmas
morning, Mr. Jakobs received a very beautiful box of chocolates
by post, 'with every good wish,' from somebody who did not
trouble to send his or her name. Mr. Jakobs, being no lover of
chocolate drops, wondered what it had cost and wished the kindly
donor had sent beer.</p>

<p>"Hi, Spot, catch!" said Mr. Jakobs, and tossed a specimen of
the confectioner's art to his dog, who possessed a sweet
tooth.</p>

<p>The dog ate it, wagging his tail, then he stopped wagging his
tail and lay down with a shiver&mdash;dead.</p>

<p>It was some time before Willie Jakobs realized the connection
between the stiff little dog and this bland and ornate Christmas
gift.</p>

<p>He tried a chocolate on his landlord's dog, and it died. He
experimented on a fellow-lodger's canary, and it died
too&mdash;he might have destroyed the whole of Somers Town's
domestic menagerie but for the timely intervention of his
landlord, who gave him in charge for his initial murder. Then the
truth came out. The chocolates were poisoned. Willie Jakobs found
his photograph in the public Press as the hero of a poisoning
mystery: an embarrassment for Willie, who was promptly recognized
by a Canning Town tradesman he had once victimized, and was
arrested for the second time in a week.</p>

<p>Willie came out of gaol (it was a "carpet") expecting to find
an accumulation of one-pound postal orders awaiting him. Instead
he found one five-pound note and a typewritten letter, on
perfectly plain uncompromising paper, to the effect that the
sender regretted that further supplies need not be expected.</p>

<p>Willie wrote to Colonel Black, and received in reply a letter
in which "Colonel Black could not grasp the contents of yours of
the 4th. He has never sent money, and fails to understand why the
writer should have expected," etc., etc.</p>

<p>Willie, furious and hurt at the base ingratitude and duplicity
of his patron, carried the letter and a story to a solicitor, and
the solicitor said one word&mdash;"Blackmail!" Here, then, was a
disgruntled Willie Jakobs forced to work: to depend upon chance
bookings and precarious liftings. Fortunately his right hand had
not lost its cunning, nor, for the matter of that, had his left.
He "clicked" to good stuff, fenced it with the new man in
Eveswell Road (he was lagged eventually because he was only an
amateur and gave too much for the stuff), and did well&mdash;so
well, indeed, that he was inclined to take a mild view of Black's
offences.</p>

<p>On the evening of Lord Verlond's dinner party&mdash;though, to
do him justice, it must be confessed that Jakobs knew nothing of
his lordship's plans&mdash;he sallied forth on business intent.
He made his way through the tiny court and narrow streets which
separated him from Stibbington Street, there turning southwards
to the Euston Road, and taking matters leisurely, he made his way
to Tottenham Court Road, en route to Oxford Street.</p>

<p>Tottenham Court Road, on that particular night, was filled
with interested people. They were interested in shop windows,
interested in one another, interested in boarding and alighting
from buses. It was an ideal crowd from Jakobs' point of view. He
liked people who concentrated, who fixed their minds on one thing
and had no thought for any other. In a sense he was something of
a psychologist, and he looked around to find some opulent person
whose powers of concentration might be of service to himself.</p>

<p>Gathered round the steps of an omnibus, impatiently waiting
for other passengers to disembark, was a little crowd of people,
and Jakobs, with his quick, keen eye, spotted a likely
client.</p>

<p>He was a stout man of middle age. His hat was placed at such
an angle on his head that the Somers Towner diagnosed him as
"canned." He may or may not have been right in his surmise. It is
sufficient that he appeared comfortably off, and that not only
was his coat of good material, but he had various indications of
an ostentatious character testifying to his present affluence.
Willie Jakobs had had no intention of taking a bus ride. I doubt
very much whether he changed his plans even now, but certain it
is that he began to elbow his way into the little throng which
surrounded the bus, by this time surging forward to board it.</p>

<p>He elbowed his way with good effect, for suddenly ceasing his
efforts, as though he had remembered some very important
engagement, he began to back out. He reached the outskirts of the
little knot, then turned to walk briskly away.</p>

<p>At that moment a firm hand dropped on his shoulder in quite a
friendly way. He looked round quickly. A tall young man in
civilian dress stood behind him.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said the young man, kindly enough, "aren't you going
on?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Fellowe," he said. "I was going down for a blow, but
I remember I left the gas burning at home."</p>

<p>"Let's go back and put it out," said Constable Fellowe, who
was on a very special duty that night.</p>

<p>"On second thoughts," said Jakobs reflectively, "I don't think
it's worth while. After all, it's one of those penny-in-the-slot
machines and it can only burn itself out."</p>

<p>"Then come along and see if my gas is burning," said Frank
humorously.</p>

<p>He held the other's arm lightly, but when Jakobs attempted to
disengage himself he found the pressure on his arm increased.
"What's the game?" he asked innocently.</p>

<p>"The same old game," said Frank, with a little smile. "Hullo.
Willie, you've dropped something."</p>

<p>He stooped quickly, without releasing his hold, and picked up
a pocket-book.</p>

<p>The bus was on the point of moving off as Frank swung round
and with a signal stopped the conductor. "I think some one who
has just boarded your bus has lost a pocket-book. I think it is
that stoutish gentleman who has just gone inside."</p>

<p>The stoutish gentleman hastily descended to make a public
examination of his wardrobe. He discovered himself minus several
articles which should, by all laws affecting the right of
property, have been upon his person.</p>

<p>Thereafter the matter became a fairly commonplace incident.
"It's a cop," said Willie philosophically. "I didn't see you
around, Mr. Fellowe."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you did, yet I'm big enough."</p>

<p>"And ugly enough," added Willie impartially.</p>

<p>Frank smiled. "You're not much of an authority on beauty,
Willie, are you?" he asked jocosely, as they threaded their way
through the streets which separated them from the nearest
police-station.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," said Willie, "'andsome is as 'andsome
does. Say, Mr. Fellowe, why don't the police go after a man like
Olloroff? What are they worrying about a little hook like me
for&mdash;getting my living at great inconvenience, in a manner
of speaking. He is a fellow who makes his thousands, and has
ruined his hundreds. Can you get him a lagging?"</p>

<p>"In time I hope we shall," said Frank.</p>

<p>"There's a feller!" said Willie. "He baits the poor little
clerk&mdash;gets him to put up a fiver to buy a million pounds'
worth of gold mines. Clerk puts it&mdash;pinches the money from
the till, not meanin' to be dishonest, in a manner of speakin',
but expectin' one day to walk into his boss, covered with fame
and diamonds, and say, 'Look at your long-lost Horace!' See what
I mean?"</p>

<p>Frank nodded.</p>

<p>"'Look at your prodigal cashier'," Jakobs continued, carried
away by his imagination. "'Put your lamps over my shiners, run
your hooks over me Astrakhan collar. Master, it is I, thy
servant!'"</p>

<p>It was not curious that they should speak of Black. There had
been a case in court that day in which a too-credulous client of
Black's, who had suffered as a result of that credulity, had sued
the colonel for the return of his money, and the case had not
been defended.</p>

<p>"I used to work for him," said Mr. Jakobs, reminiscently.
"Messenger at twenty-nine shillings a week&mdash;like bein'
messenger at a mortuary." He looked up at Frank. "Ever count up
the number of Black's friends who've died suddenly?" he asked.
"Ever reckon that up? He's a regular jujube tree, he is."</p>

<p>"'Upas' is the word you want, Willie," said Frank gently.</p>

<p>"You wait till the Four get him," warned Mr. Jakobs
cheerfully. "They won't half put his light out."</p>

<p>He said no more for a while, then he turned suddenly to
Frank.</p>

<p>"Come to think of it, Fellowe," he said, with the gross
familiarity of the habitue in dealing with his captor, "this is
the third time you've pinched me."</p>

<p>"Come to think of it," admitted Frank cheerfully, "it is."</p>

<p>"Harf a mo'." Mr. Jakobs halted and surveyed the other with a
puzzled air. "He took me in the Tottenham Court Road, he took me
in the Charin' Cross Road, an' he apperryhended me in
Cheapside."</p>

<p>"You've a wonderful memory," smiled the young man.</p>

<p>"Never on his beat," said Mr. Jakobs to himself, "always in
plain clothes, an' generally watchin' me&mdash;now, why?"</p>

<p>Frank thought a moment. "Come and have a cup of tea, Willie,"
he said, "and I will tell you a fairy story."</p>

<p>"I think we shall be gettin' at facts very soon," said Willie,
in his best judicial manner.</p>

<p>"I am going to be perfectly frank with you, my friend," said
Fellowe, when they were seated in a neighbouring coffee-shop.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind," begged Willie, "I'd rather call you by
your surname&mdash;I don't want it to get about that I'm a pal of
yours."</p>

<p>Frank smiled again. Willie had ever been a source of
amusement. "You have been taken by me three times," he said, "and
this is the first time you have mentioned our friend Black. I
think I can say that if you had mentioned him before it might
have made a lot of difference to you, Willie."</p>

<p>Mr. Jakobs addressed the ceiling. "Come to think of it," he
said, "he 'inted at this once before."</p>

<p>"I 'int at it once again," said Frank. "Will you tell me why
Black pays you two pounds a week?"</p>

<p>"Because he don't," said Willie promptly. "Because he's a
sneakin' hook an' because he's a twister, because he's a
liar&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If there's any reason you haven't mentioned, give it a run."
said Constable Fellowe in the vernacular.</p>

<p>Willie hesitated. "What's the good of my tellin' you?" he
asked. "Sure as death you'll tell me 'I'm only lyin'."</p>

<p>"Try me," said Frank, and for an hour they sat talking,
policeman and thief.</p>

<p>At the end of that time they went different ways&mdash;Frank
to the police-station, where he found an irate owner of property
awaiting him, and Mr. Jakobs, thankfully, yet apprehensively, to
his Somers Town home.</p>

<p>His business completed at the station, and a station sergeant
alternately annoyed and mystified by the erratic behaviour of a
plain-clothes constable, who gave orders with the assurance of an
Assistant-Commissioner, Frank found a taxi and drove first to the
house of Black, and later (with instructions to the driver to
break all the rules laid down for the regulation of traffic) to
Hampstead.</p>

<p>May Sandford was expecting the colonel. She stood by the
drawing-room fire, buttoning her glove and endeavouring to
disguise her pleasure that her sometime friend had called.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" was his first blunt greeting, and the
girl stiffened.</p>

<p>"You have no right to ask in that tone," she said quietly,
"but I will tell you. I am going to dinner."</p>

<p>"With whom?"</p>

<p>The colour came to her face, for she was really annoyed. "With
Colonel Black," she said an effort to restrain her rising
anger.</p>

<p>He nodded. "I'm afraid I cannot allow you to go." he said
coolly.</p>

<p>The girl stared. "Once and for all, Mr. Fellowe," she said
with quiet dignity, "you will understand that I am my own
mistress. I shall do as I please. You have no right to dictate to
me&mdash;you have no right whatever"&mdash;she stamped her foot
angrily&mdash;"to say what I may do and what I may not do. I
shall go where and with whom I choose."</p>

<p>"You will not go out to-night, at any rate," said Frank
grimly.</p>

<p>An angry flush came to her cheeks. "If I chose to go to-night,
I should go to-night," she said.</p>

<p>"Indeed, you will do nothing of the sort." He was quite cool
now&mdash;master of himself&mdash;completely under control.</p>

<p>"I shall be outside this house," he said, "for the rest of the
night. If you go out with this man I shall arrest you." She
started and took a step back. "I shall arrest you," he went on
determinedly. "I don't care what happens to me afterwards. I will
trump up any charge against you. I will take you to the station,
through the streets, and put you in the iron dock as though you
were a common thief. I'll do it because I love you," he said
passionately, "because you are the biggest thing in the world to
me&mdash;because I love you better than life, better than you can
love yourself, better than any man could love you. And do you
know why I will take you to the police-station?" he went on
earnestly. "Because you will be safe there, and the women who
look after you will allow no dog like this fellow to have
communication with you&mdash;because he dare not follow you
there, whatever else he dare. As for him&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned savagely about as a resplendent Black entered the
room. Black stopped at the sight of the other's face and dropped
his hand to his pocket.</p>

<p>"You look out for me," said Frank, and Black's face
blanched.</p>

<p>The girl had recovered her speech. "How dare you&mdash;how
dare you!" she whispered. "You tell me that you will arrest me.
How dare you! And you say you love me!" she said scornfully.</p>

<p>He nodded slowly. "Yes," he said, quietly enough. "I love you.
I love you enough to make you hate me. Can I love you any more
than that?"</p>

<p>His voice was bitter, and there was something of helplessness
in it too, but the determination that underlay his words could
not be mistaken. He did not leave her until Black had taken his
leave, and in his pardonable perturbation he forgot that he
intended searching the colonel for a certain green bottle with a
glass stopper.</p>

<p>Colonel Black returned to his flat that night to find
unmistakable evidence that the apartment had been most
systematically searched. There existed, however, no evidence as
to how his visitors had gained admission. The doors had been
opened, despite the fact that they were fastened by a key which
had no duplicate, and with locks that were apparently unpickable.
The windows were intact, and no attempt had been made to remove
money and valuables from the desk which had been ransacked. The
only proof of identity they had left behind was the seal which he
found attached to the blotting-pad on his desk.</p>

<p>They had gone methodically to work, dropped a neat round
splash of sealing-wax, and had as neatly pressed the seal of the
organization upon it. There was no other communication, but in
its very simplicity this plain "IV" was a little terrifying. It
seemed that the members of the Four defied all his efforts at
security, laughed to scorn his patent locks, knew more about his
movements than his most intimate friends, and chose their own
time for their visitations.</p>

<p>This would have been disconcerting to a man of less character
than Black; but Black was one who had lived through a score of
years&mdash;each year punctuated, at regular intervals, with
threats of the most terrible character. He had ever lived in the
shadow of reprisal, yet he had never suffered punishment.</p>

<p>It was his most fervent boast that he never lost his temper,
that he never did anything in a flurry. Now, perhaps for the
first time in his life, he was going to work actuated by a
greater consideration than self-interest&mdash;a consideration of
vengeance.</p>

<p>It made him less careful than he was wont to be. He did not
look for shadowers that evening, yet shadowers there had
been&mdash;not one but many.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11">XI.&mdash;TO LINCOLN
RACES</a></h2>

<p class="first">SIR ISAAC TRAMBER went to Lincoln in an evil
frame of mind. He had reserved a compartment, and cursed his luck
when he discovered that his reservation adjoined that of Horace
Gresham.</p>

<p>He paced the long platform at King's Cross, waiting for his
guests. The Earl of Verlond had promised to go down with him and
to bring Lady Mary, and it was no joy to Sir Isaac to observe on
the adjoining carriage the label, "Reserved for Mr. Horace
Gresham and party."</p>

<p>Horace came along about five minutes before the train started.
He was as cheerful as the noonday sun, in striking contrast to
Sir Isaac, whose night had not been too wisely spent. He nodded
carelessly to Sir Isaac's almost imperceptible greeting.</p>

<p>The baronet glanced at his watch and inwardly swore at the old
earl and his caprices. It wanted three minutes to the hour at
which the train left. His tongue was framing a bitter indictment
of the old man when he caught a glimpse of his tall, angular
figure striding along the platform.</p>

<p>"Thought we weren't coming. I suppose?" asked the earl, as he
made his way to the compartment. "I say, you thought we weren't
coming?" he repeated, as Lady Mary entered the compartment,
assisted with awkward solicitude by Sir Isaac.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't expect you to be late."</p>

<p>"We are not late," said the earl.</p>

<p>He settled himself comfortably in a corner seat&mdash;the seat
which Sir Isaac had specially arranged for the girl. Friends of
his and of the old man who passed nodded. An indiscreet few came
up to speak.</p>

<p>"Going up to Lincoln, Lord Verlond?" asked one idle youth.</p>

<p>"No," said the earl sweetly, "I am going to bed with the
mumps." He snarled the last word, and the young seeker after
information fled.</p>

<p>"You can sit by me, Ikey&mdash;leave Mary alone," said the old
man sharply. "I want to know all about this horse. I have £150 on
this thoroughbred of yours; it is far more important than those
fatuous inquiries you intend making of my niece."</p>

<p>"Inquiries?" grumbled Sir Isaac resentfully.</p>

<p>"Inquiries!" repeated the other. "You want to know whether she
slept last night; whether she finds it too warm in this carriage;
whether she would like a corner seat or a middle seat, her back
to the engine or her face to the engine. Leave her alone, leave
her alone, Ikey. She'll decide all that. I know her better than
you."</p>

<p>He glared, with that amusing glint in his eyes, across at the
girl. "Young Gresham is in the next carriage. Go and tap at the
window and bring him out. Go along!"</p>

<p>"He's got some friends there, I think, uncle," said the
girl.</p>

<p>"Never mind about his friends," said Verlond irritably. "What
the devil does it matter about his friends? Aren't you a friend?
Go and tap at the door and bring him out."</p>

<p>Sir Isaac was fuming.</p>

<p>"I don't want him in here," he said loudly. "You seem to
forget, Verlond, that if you want to talk about horses, this is
the very chap who should know nothing about Timbolino."</p>

<p>"Ach!" said the earl testily, "don't you suppose he knows all
there is to be known. What do you think sporting papers are
for?"</p>

<p>"Sporting papers can't tell a man what the owner knows," said
Sir Isaac importantly.</p>

<p>"They tell me more than he knows," he said. "Your horse was
favourite yesterday morning&mdash;it isn't favourite any more,
Ikey."</p>

<p>"I can't control the investments of silly asses," grumbled Sir
Isaac.</p>

<p>"Except one." said the earl rudely. "But these silly asses you
refer to do not throw their money away&mdash;remember that, Ikey.
When you have had as much racing as I have had, and won as much
money as I have won, you'll take no notice of what owners think
of their horses. You might as well ask a mother to give a candid
opinion of her own daughter's charms as to ask an owner for
unbiased information about his own horse."</p>

<p>The train had slipped through the grimy purlieus of London and
was now speeding through green fields to Hatfield. It was a
glorious spring day, mellow with sunlight: such a day as a man at
peace with the world might live with complete enjoyment.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac was not in this happy position, nor was he in a mood
to discuss either the probity of racing men or the general
question of the sport itself. He observed with an inward curse
the girl rise and walk, apparently carelessly, into the corridor.
He could have sworn he heard a tap at the window of the next
compartment, but in this, of course, he was wrong. She merely
moved across the vision of the little coterie who sat laughing
and talking, and in an instant Horace had come out.</p>

<p>"It is not my fault this, really," she greeted him, with a
little flush in her cheeks. "It was uncle's idea."</p>

<p>"Your uncle is an admirable old gentleman," said Horace
fervently. "I retract anything I may have said to his
discredit."</p>

<p>"I will tell him," she said, with mock gravity.</p>

<p>"No, no," cried Horace, "I don't want you to do that
exactly."</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you seriously," said she suddenly. "Come
into our compartment. Uncle and Sir Isaac are so busy discussing
the merits of Timbolino&mdash;is that the right name?" He nodded,
his lips twitching with amusement. "That they won't notice
anything we have to say," she concluded.</p>

<p>The old earl gave him a curt nod. Sir Isaac only vouchsafed a
scowl. It was difficult to maintain anything like a confidential
character in their conversation, but by manoeuvring so that they
spoke only of the more important things when Sir Isaac and his
truculent guest were at the most heated point of their argument,
she was able to unburden the anxiety of her mind.</p>

<p>"I am worried about uncle," she said in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Is he ill?" asked Horace.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No, it isn't his illness&mdash;yet it may
be. But he is so contradictory; I am so afraid that it might
react to our disadvantage. You know how willing he was that you
should... " She hesitated, and his hand sought hers under the
cover of an open newspaper.</p>

<p>"It was marvellous," he whispered, "wasn't it? I never
expected for one moment that the old dev&mdash;that your dear
uncle," he corrected himself, "would have been so amenable."</p>

<p>She nodded again. "You see," she said, taking advantage of
another heated passage between the old man and the irritated
baronet, "what he does so impetuously he can undo just as easily.
I am so afraid he will turn and rend you."</p>

<p>"Let him try," said Horace. "I am not easily rent."</p>

<p>Their conversation was cut short abruptly by the intervention
of the man they were discussing.</p>

<p>"Look here, Gresham," snapped the earl shortly, "you're one of
the cognoscenti, and I suppose you know everything. Who are the
Four Just Men I hear people talking about?"</p>

<p>Horace was conscious of the fact that the eyes of Sir Isaac
Tramber were fixed on him curiously. He was a man who made no
disguise of his suspicion.</p>

<p>"I know no more than you," said Horace. "They seem to me to be
an admirable body of people who go about correcting social
evils."</p>

<p>"Who are they to judge what is and what is not evil?" growled
the earl, scowling from under his heavy eyebrows. "Infernal
cheek! What do we pay judges and jurymen and coroners and
policemen and people of that sort for, eh? What do we pay taxes
for, and rent for, and police rates, and gas rates, and water
rates, and every kind of dam' rate that the devilish ingenuity of
man can devise? Do we do it that these jackanapes can come along
and interfere with the course of justice? It's absurd! It's
ridiculous!" he stormed.</p>

<p>Horace threw out a protesting hand. "Don't blame me," he
said.</p>

<p>"But you approve of them," accused the earl. "Ikey says you
do, and Ikey knows everything&mdash;don't you, Ikey?"</p>

<p>Sir Isaac shifted uncomfortably in his seat. "I didn't say
Gresham knew anything about it," he began lamely.</p>

<p>"Why do you lie, Ikey; why do you lie?" asked the old man
testily. "You just told me that you were perfectly sure that
Gresham was one of the leading spirits of the gang."</p>

<p>Sir Isaac, inured as he was to the brutal indiscretions of his
friends, went a dull red. "Oh, I didn't mean that exactly," he
said awkwardly and a little angrily. "Dash it, Lord Verlond,
don't embarrass a fellow by rendering him liable to heavy damages
an all that sort of thing."</p>

<p>Horace was unperturbed by the other's confusion. "You needn't
bother yourself," he said coolly. "I should never think of taking
you to a court of justice."</p>

<p>He turned again to the girl, and the earl claimed the
baronet's attention. The old man had a trick of striking off at a
tangent; from one subject to another he leapt like a
will-o'-the-wisp. Before Horace had framed half a dozen words the
old man was dragging his unwilling victim along a piscatorial
road, and Sir Isaac was floundering out of his depths in a
morass&mdash;if the metaphor be excused&mdash;of salmon-fishing,
trout-poaching, pike-fishing&mdash;a sport on which Sir Isaac
Tramber could by no means deem himself an authority.</p>

<p>It was soon after lunch that the train pulled into Lincoln.
Horace usually rented a house outside the town, but this year he
had arranged to go and return to London on the same night. At the
station he parted with the girl.</p>

<p>"I shall see you on the course," he said. "What are your
arrangements? Do you go back to town to-night?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "Is this a very important race for you to win?"
she asked, a little anxiously.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Nobody really bothers overmuch about the
Lincolnshire Handicap," he said. "You see, it's too early in the
season for even the gamblers to put their money down with any
assurance. One doesn't know much, and it is almost impossible to
tell what horses are in form. I verily believe that Nemesis will
win but everything is against her.</p>

<p>"You see, the Lincoln," continued Horace doubtfully, "is a
race which is not usually won by a filly, and then, too, she is a
sprinter. I know sprinters have won the race before, and every
year have been confidently expected to win it again; but the
averages are all against a horse like Nemesis."</p>

<p>"But I thought," she said in wonder, "that you were so
confident about her."</p>

<p>He laughed a little. "Well, you know, one is awfully confident
on Monday and full of doubts on Tuesday. That is part of the
game; the form of horses is not half as inconsistent as the form
of owners. I shall probably meet a man this morning who will tell
me that some horse is an absolute certainty for the last race of
the day. He will hold me by the buttonhole and he will drum into
me the fact that this is the most extraordinarily easy method of
picking up money that was ever invented since racing started.
When I meet him after the last race he will coolly inform me that
he did not back that horse, but had some tip at the last moment
from an obscure individual who knew the owner's aunt's sister.
You mustn't expect one to be consistent.</p>

<p>"I still think Nemesis will win," he went on, "but I am not so
confident as I was. The most cocksure of students gets a little
glum in the face of the examiner."</p>

<p>The earl had joined them and was listening to the conversation
with a certain amount of grim amusement. "Ikey is certain
Timbolino will win," he said, "even in the face of the examiner.
Somebody has just told me that the examiner is rather soft under
foot."</p>

<p>"You mean the course?" asked Horace, a little anxiously.</p>

<p>The earl nodded. "It won't suit yours, my friend," he said. "A
sprinter essaying the Lincolnshire wants good going. I can see
myself taking £1,500 back to London to-day."</p>

<p>"Have you backed Timbolino?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask impertinent questions," said the earl curtly. "And
unnecessary questions," he went on. "You know infernally well
I've backed Timbolino. Don't you believe me? I've backed it and
I'm afraid I'm not going to win."</p>

<p>"Afraid?" Whatever faults the old man had, Horace knew him for
a good loser.</p>

<p>The earl nodded. He was not amused now. He had dropped like a
cloak the assumption of that little unpleasant leering attitude.
He was, Horace saw for the first time, a singularly good-looking
old man. The firm lines of the mouth were straight, and the pale
face, in repose, looked a little sad.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm afraid," he said. His voice was even and without the
bitter quality of cynicism which was his everlasting pose. "This
race makes a lot of difference to some people. It doesn't affect
me very much," he said, and the corner of his mouth twitched a
little. "But there are people," he went on seriously, "to whom
this race makes a difference between life and death." There was a
sudden return to his usual abrupt manner. "Eh? How does that
strike you for good melodrama, Mr. Gresham?"</p>

<p>Horace shook his head in bewilderment. "I'm afraid I don't
follow you at all. Lord Verlond."</p>

<p>"You may follow me in another way," said the earl briskly.
"Here is my car. Good morning."</p>

<p>Horace watched him out of sight and then made his way to the
racecourse. The old man had puzzled him not a little. He bore, as
Horace knew, a reputation which, if not unsavoury, was at least
unpleasant. He was credited with having the most malicious tongue
in London. But when Horace came to think, as he did, walking
along the banks of the river on his way to the course, there was
little that the old man had ever said which would injure or hurt
innocent people. His cynicism was in the main directed against
his own class, his savageness most manifested against notorious
sinners. Men like Sir Isaac Tramber felt the lash of his
tongue.</p>

<p>His treatment of his heir was, of course, inexcusable. The
earl himself never excused it; he persistently avoided the
subject, and it would be a bold man who would dare to raise so
unpleasant a topic against the earl's wishes.</p>

<p>He was known to be extraordinarily wealthy, and Horace Gresham
had reason for congratulating himself that he had been specially
blessed with this world's goods. Otherwise his prospects would
not have been of the brightest. That he was himself enormously
rich precluded any suggestion (and the suggestion would have been
inevitable) that he hunted Lady Mary's fortune. It was a matter
of supreme indifference to himself whether she inherited the
Verlond millions or whether she came to him empty-handed.</p>

<p>There were other people in Lincoln that day who did not take
so philosophical a view of the situation.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac had driven straight to the house on the hill leading
to the Minster, which Black had engaged for two days. He was in a
very bad temper when at last he reached his destination. Black
was sitting at lunch. Black looked up as the other entered.
"Hullo, Ikey," he said, "come and sit down."</p>

<p>Sir Isaac looked at the menu with some disfavour. "Thanks," he
said shortly, "I've lunched on the train. I want to talk to
you."</p>

<p>"Talk away," said Black, helping himself to another cutlet. He
was a good trencherman&mdash;a man who found exquisite enjoyment
in his meals.</p>

<p>"Look here. Black," said Isaac, "things are pretty desperate.
Unless that infernal horse of mine wins to-day I shall not know
what to do for money."</p>

<p>"I know one thing you won't be able to do," said Black coolly,
"and that is, come to me. I am in as great straits as you." He
pushed back his plate and took a cigar-case from his pocket.
"What do we stand to win on this Timbolino of yours?"</p>

<p>"About £25,000," said Sir Isaac moodily. "I don't know if the
infernal thing will win. It would be just my luck if it doesn't.
I am afraid of this horse of Gresham's."</p>

<p>Black laughed softly. "That's a new fear of yours," he said.
"I don't remember having heard it before."</p>

<p>"It's no laughing matter," said the other. "I had my trainer,
Tubbs, down watching her work. She is immensely fast. The only
thing is whether she can stay the distance."</p>

<p>"Can't she be got at?" asked Black.</p>

<p>"Got at!" said the other impatiently. "The race will be run in
three hours' time! Where do you get your idea of racing from?" he
asked irritably. "You can't poison horses at three hours' notice.
You can't even poison them at three days' notice, unless you've
got the trainer in with you. And trainers of that kind only live
in novels."</p>

<p>Black was carefully cutting the end of his cigar. "So if your
horse loses we shall be in High Street, Hellboro'?" he reflected.
"I have backed it to save my life." He said this in grim
earnest.</p>

<p>He rang a bell. The servant came in. "Tell them to bring round
the carriage," he said. He looked at his watch. "I am not
particularly keen on racing, but I think I shall enjoy this day
in the open. It gives one a chance of thinking."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12">XII.&mdash;THE RACE</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE curious ring on the Carholme was crowded.
Unusually interested in the Lincoln handicap was the sporting
world, and this, together with the glorious weather, had drawn
sportsmen from north and south to meet together on this great
festival of English racing. Train and steamer had brought the
Wanderers back to the fold. There were men with a tan of Egypt on
their cheeks, men who had been to the south to avoid the vigorous
and searching tests of an English winter; there were men who came
from Monte Carlo, and lean, brown men who had spent the dark days
of the year amongst the snows of the Alps.</p>

<p>There were regular followers of the game who had known no
holiday, and had followed the jumping season with religious
attention. There were rich men and comparatively poor men; little
tradesmen who found this the most delightful of their holidays;
members of Parliament who had snatched a day from the dreariness
of the Parliamentary debates; sharpers on the look-out for
possible victims; these latter quiet, unobtrusive men whose eyes
were constantly on the move for a likely subject. There was a
sprinkling of journalists, cheery and sceptical, young men and
old men, farmers in their gaiters&mdash;all drawn together in one
great brotherhood by a love of the sport of kings.</p>

<p>In the crowded paddock the horses engaged in the first race
were walking round, led by diminutive stable-lads, the number of
each horse strapped to the boy's arm.</p>

<p>"A rough lot of beggars," said Gresham, looking them over.
Most of them still had their winter coats; most of them were
grossly fat and unfitted for racing. He was ticking the horses
off on his card; some he immediately dismissed as of no account.
He found Lady Mary wandering around the paddock by herself. She
greeted him as a shipwrecked mariner greets a sail.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you've come," she said. "I know nothing whatever
about racing." She looked round the paddock. "Won't you tell me
something. Are all these horses really fit?"</p>

<p>"You evidently know something about horses," he smiled. "No,
they're not."</p>

<p>"But surely they can't win if they're not fit," she said in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"They can't all win," replied the young man, laughing.
"They're not all intended to win, either. You see, a trainer may
not be satisfied his horse is top-hole. He sends him out to have
a feeler, so to speak, at the opposition. The fittest horse will
probably win this race. The trainer who is running against him
with no hope of success will discover how near to fitness his own
beast is!"</p>

<p>"I want to find Timbolino," she said, looking at her card.
"That's Sir Isaac's, isn't it?"</p>

<p>He nodded. "I was looking for him myself," he said. "Come
along, and let's see if we can find him."</p>

<p>In a corner of the paddock they discovered the horse&mdash;a
tall, upstanding animal, well muscled, so far as Horace could
judge, for the horse was still in his cloths.</p>

<p>"A nice type of horse for the Lincoln," he said thoughtfully.
"I saw him at Ascot last year. I think this is the fellow we've
got to beat."</p>

<p>"Does Sir Isaac own many horses?" she asked.</p>

<p>"A few," he said. "He is a remarkable man."</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?" she asked.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, one knows... " Then he
realized that it wasn't playing cricket to speak disparagingly of
a possible rival, and she rightly interpreted his silence.</p>

<p>"Where does Sir Isaac make his money?" she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>He looked at her. "I don't know," he said. "He's got some
property somewhere, hasn't he?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No," she said. "I am not asking," she
went on quickly, "because I have any possible interest in his
wealth or his prospects. All my interest is
centred&mdash;elsewhere." She favoured him with a dazzling little
smile.</p>

<p>Although the paddock was crowded and the eyes of many people
were upon him, the owner of the favourite had all his work to
restrain himself from taking her hand.</p>

<p>She changed the subject abruptly. "So now let's come and see
your great horse," she said gaily.</p>

<p>He led her over to one of the boxes where Nemesis was
receiving the attention of an earnest groom.</p>

<p>There was not much of her. She was of small build, clean of
limb, with a beautiful head and a fine neck not usually seen in
so small a thoroughbred. She had run a good fourth in the
Cambridgeshire of the previous year, and had made steady
improvement from her three-year-old to her four-year-old
days.</p>

<p>Horace looked her over critically. His practised eye could see
no fault in her condition. She looked very cool, ideally fit for
the task of the afternoon. He knew that her task was a difficult
one; he knew, too, that he had in his heart really very little
fear that she could fail to negotiate the easy mile of the
Carholme. There were many horses in the race who were also
sprinters, and they would make the pace a terrifically fast one.
If stamina was a weak point, it would betray her.</p>

<p>The previous day, on the opening of the racing season, his
stable had run a horse in a selling plate, and it was encouraging
that this animal, though carrying top weight, beat his field
easily. It was this fact that had brought Nemesis to the position
of short-priced favourite.</p>

<p>Gresham himself had very little money upon her; he did not bet
very heavily, though he was credited with making and losing
fabulous sums each year. He gained nothing by contradicting these
rumours. He was sufficiently indifferent to the opinions of his
fellows not to suffer any inconvenience from their
repetition.</p>

<p>But the shortening of price on Nemesis was a serious matter
for the connection of Timbolino. They could not cover their
investments by "saving" on Nemesis without a considerable
outlay.</p>

<p>Horace was at lunch when the second race was run. He had found
Lord Verlond wonderfully gracious; to the young man's surprise
his lordship had accepted his invitation with such matter-of-fact
heartiness as to suggest he had expected it. "I suppose," he
said, with a little twinkle in his eye, "you haven't invited
Ikey?"</p>

<p>Gresham shook his head smilingly. "No, I do not think Sir
Isaac quite approves of me."</p>

<p>"I do not think he does," agreed the other. "Anyway, he's got
a guest of his own, Colonel Black. I assure you it is through no
act of mine. Ikey introduced him to me, somewhat unnecessarily,
but Ikey is always doing unnecessary things."</p>

<p>"A very amiable person," continued the earl, busy with his
knife and fork; "he 'lordshipped' me and 'my lorded' me as though
he were the newest kind of barrister and I was the oldest and
wiliest of assize judges. He treated me with that respect which
is only accorded to those who are expected to pay eventually for
the privilege. Ikey was most anxious that he should create a good
impression."</p>

<p>It may be said with truth that Black saw the net closing round
him. He knew not what mysterious influences were at work, but day
by day, in a hundred different ways, he found himself thwarted,
new obstacles put in his way. He was out now for a final
kill.</p>

<p>He was recalled to a realization of the present by the
strident voices of the bookmakers about him; the ring was in a
turmoil. He heard a voice shout, "Seven to one, bar one! Seven to
one Nemesis!" and he knew enough of racing to realize what had
happened to the favourite. He came to a bookmaker he knew
slightly. "What are you barring?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Timbolino," was the reply.</p>

<p>He found Sir Isaac near the enclosure. The baronet was looking
a muddy white, and was biting his finger-nails with an air of
perturbation.</p>

<p>"What has made your horse so strong a favourite?"</p>

<p>"I backed it again," said Sir Isaac.</p>

<p>"Backed it again?"</p>

<p>"I've got to do something," said the other savagely. "If I
lose, well, I lose more than I can pay. I might as well add to my
liabilities. I tell you I'm down and out if this thing doesn't
win," he said, "unless you can do something for me. You can,
can't you, Black, old sport?" he asked entreatingly. "There's no
reason why you and I should have any secrets from one
another."</p>

<p>Black looked at him steadily. If the horse lost he might be
able to use this man to greater advantage.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac's next words suggested that in case of necessity
help would be forthcoming. "It's that beastly Verlond," he said
bitterly. "He put the girl quite against me&mdash;she treats me
as though I were dirt&mdash;and I thought I was all right there.
I've been backing on the strength of the money coming to me."</p>

<p>"What has happened recently?" asked Black.</p>

<p>"I got her by myself just now," said the baronet, "and put it
to her plain; but it's no go. Black, she gave me the frozen
face&mdash;turned me down proper. It's perfectly damnable," he
almost wailed.</p>

<p>Black nodded. At that moment there was a sudden stir in the
ring. Over the heads of the crowd from where they stood they saw
the bright-coloured caps of the jockeys cantering down to the
post.</p>

<p>Unlike Sir Isaac, who had carefully avoided the paddock after
a casual glance at his candidate, Horace was personally
supervising the finishing touches to Nemesis. He saw the girths
strapped and gave his last instructions to the jockey. Then, as
the filly was led to the course, with one final backward and
approving glance at her, he turned towards the ring.</p>

<p>"One moment, Gresham!" Lord Verlond was behind him. "Do you
think your horse," said the old man, with a nod towards Nemesis,
"is going to win?"</p>

<p>Horace nodded. "I do now," he said; "in fact, I am rather
confident."</p>

<p>"Do you think," the other asked slowly, "that if your horse
doesn't, Timbolino will?"</p>

<p>Horace looked at him curiously. "Yes, Lord Verlond, I do," he
said quietly.</p>

<p>Again there was a pause, the old man fingering his shaven chin
absently. "Suppose, Gresham," he said, without raising his voice,
"suppose I asked you to pull your horse?"</p>

<p>The face of the young man went suddenly red. "You're joking,
Lord Verlond," he answered stiffly.</p>

<p>"I'm not joking," said the other. "I'm speaking to you as a
man of honour, and I am trusting to your respecting my
confidence. Suppose I asked you to pull Nemesis, would you do
it?"</p>

<p>"No, frankly, I would not," said the other, "but I
can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind what you can't understand," said Lord Verlond,
with a return of his usual sharpness. "If I asked you and offered
you as a reward what you desired most, would you do it?"</p>

<p>"I would not do it for anything in the world," said Horace
gravely.</p>

<p>A bitter little smile came to the old man's face. "I see," he
said.</p>

<p>"I can't understand why you ask me," said Horace, who was
still bewildered. "Surely you&mdash;you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I only know that you think I want you to pull your horse
because I have backed the other." said the old earl, with just a
ghost of a smile on his thin lips. "I would advise you not to be
too puffed up with pride at your own rectitude," he said
unpleasantly, though the little smile still lingered, "because
you may be very sorry one of these days that you did not do as I
asked."</p>

<p>"If you would tell me," began Horace, and paused. This sudden
request from the earl, who was, with all his faults, a sportsman,
left him almost speechless.</p>

<p>"I will tell you nothing," said the earl, "because I have
nothing to tell you," he added suavely.</p>

<p>Horace led the way up the stairs to the county stand. To say
that he was troubled by the extraordinary request of the old man
would be to put it mildly. He knew the earl as an eccentric man;
he knew him by reputation as an evil man, though he had no
evidence as to this. But he never in his wildest and most
uncharitable moments had imagined that this old rascal&mdash;so
he called him&mdash;would ask him to pull a horse. It was
unthinkable. He remembered that Lord Verlond was steward of one
or two big meetings, and that he was a member of one of the most
august sporting clubs in the world.</p>

<p>He elbowed his way along the top of the stand to where the
white osprey on Lady Mary's hat showed.</p>

<p>"You look troubled," she said as he reached her side. "Has
uncle been bothering you?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No," he replied, with unusual
curtness.</p>

<p>"Has your horse developed a headache?" she asked
banteringly.</p>

<p>"I was worried about something I remembered," he said
incoherently.</p>

<p>The field was at the starting-post: "Your horse is drawn in
the middle," she said.</p>

<p>He put up his glasses. He could see the chocolate and green
plainly enough. Sir Isaac's&mdash;grey vertical stripes on white,
yellow cap&mdash;was also easy to see. He had drawn the inside
right.</p>

<p>The field was giving the starter all the trouble that
twenty-four high-spirited thoroughbreds could give to any man.
For ten minutes they backed and sidled and jumped and kicked and
circled before the two long tapes. With exemplary patience the
starter waited, directing, imploring almost, commanding and, it
must be confessed, swearing, for he was a North-country starter
who had no respect for the cracks of the jockey world.</p>

<p>The wait gave Horace an opportunity for collecting his
thoughts. He had been a little upset by the strange request of
the man who was now speaking so calmly at his elbow.</p>

<p>For Sir Isaac the period of waiting had increased the tension.
His hands were shaking, his glasses went up and down, jerkily; he
was in an agony of apprehension, when suddenly the white tape
swung up, the field bunched into three sections, then spread
again and, like a cavalry regiment, came thundering down the
slight declivity on its homeward journey.</p>

<p>"They're off!"</p>

<p>A roar of voices. Every glass was focused on the oncoming
field. There was nothing in it for two furlongs; the start had
been a splendid one. They came almost in a dead line. Then
something on the rail shot out a little: it was Timbolino, going
with splendid smoothness.</p>

<p>"That looks like the winner," said Horace philosophically.
"Mine's shut in."</p>

<p>In the middle of the course the jockey on Nemesis, seeking an
opening, had dashed his mount to one which was impossible.</p>

<p>He found himself boxed between two horses, the riders of which
showed no disposition to open out for him. The field was half-way
on its journey when the boy pulled the filly out of the trap and
"came round his horses."</p>

<p>Timbolino had a two-length clear lead of Colette, which was a
length clear of a bunch of five; Nemesis, when half the journey
was done, was lying eighth or ninth.</p>

<p>Horace, on the stand, had his stop-watch in his hand. He
clicked it off as the field passed the four-furlong post and
hastily examined the dial.</p>

<p>"It's a slow race," he said, with a little thrill in his
voice.</p>

<p>At the distance, Nemesis, with a quick free stride, had shot
out of the ruck and was third, three lengths behind
Timbolino.</p>

<p>The boy on Sir Isaac's horse was running a confident race. He
had the rails and had not moved on his horse. He looked round to
see where the danger lay, and his experienced eye saw it in
Nemesis, who was going smoothly and evenly.</p>

<p>A hundred yards from the post the boy on Gresham's filly shook
her up, and in half a dozen strides she had drawn abreast of the
leader.</p>

<p>The rider of Timbolino saw the danger&mdash;he pushed his
mount, working with hands and heels upon the willing animal under
him.</p>

<p>They were running now wide of each other, dead level. The
advantage, it seemed, lay with the horse on the rails, but
Horace, watching with an expert eye from the top of the stand,
knew that the real advantage lay with the horse in the middle of
the track.</p>

<p>He had walked over the course that morning, and he knew that
it was on the crown of the track that the going was best.
Timbolino responded nobly to the efforts of his rider; once his
head got in front, and the boy on Nemesis took up his whip, but
he did not use it. He was watching the other. Then, with twenty
yards to go, he drove Nemesis forward with all the power of his
splendid hands.</p>

<p>Timbolino made one more effort, and as they flew past the
judge's box there was none save the judge who might separate
them.</p>

<p>Horace turned to the girl at his side with a critical smile.
"Oh, you've won," she said. "You did win, didn't you?" Her eyes
were blazing with excitement.</p>

<p>He shook his head smilingly. "I'm afraid I can't answer that,"
he said. "It was a very close thing."</p>

<p>He glanced at Sir Isaac. The baronet's face was livid, the
hand that he raised to his lips trembled like an aspen leaf.
"There's one man," thought Horace, "who's more worried about the
result than I am."</p>

<p>Down below in the ring there was a Babel of excited talk. It
rose up to them in a dull roar. They were betting fast and
furiously on the result, for the numbers had not yet gone up.</p>

<p>Both horses had their partisans. Then there was a din
amounting to a bellow. The judge had hoisted two noughts in the
frame. It was a dead-heat!</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said Horace.</p>

<p>It was the only comment he made.</p>

<p>He crossed to the other side of the enclosure as quickly as he
could, Sir Isaac following closely behind. As the baronet elbowed
his way through the crowd somebody caught him by the arm. He
looked round. It was Black.</p>

<p>"Run it off," said Black, in a hoarse whisper. "It was a fluke
that horse got up. Your jockey was caught napping. Run it
off."</p>

<p>Sir Isaac hesitated. "I shall get half the bets and half the
stakes," he said.</p>

<p>"Have the lot," said Black. "Go along, there is nothing to be
afraid of. I know this game; run it off. There's nothing to
prevent you winning."</p>

<p>Sir Isaac hesitated, then walked slowly to the unsaddling
enclosure. The steaming horses were being divested of their
saddles.</p>

<p>Gresham was there, looking cool and cheerful. He caught the
baronet's eye.</p>

<p>"Well, Sir Isaac," he said pleasantly, "what are you going to
do?"</p>

<p>"What do you want to do?" asked Sir Isaac suspiciously. It was
part of his creed that all men were rogues. He thought it would
be safest to do the opposite to what his rival desired. Like many
another suspicious man, he made frequent errors in his
diagnosis.</p>

<p>"I think it would be advisable to divide," said Horace. "The
horses have had a very hard race, and I think mine was unlucky
not to win."</p>

<p>That decided Sir Isaac. "We'll run it off," he said.</p>

<p>"As you will," said Horace coldly, "but I think it is only
right to warn you that my horse was boxed in half-way up the
course and but for that would have won very easily. He had to
make up half a dozen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know all about that," interrupted the other rudely, "but
none the less, I'm going to run it off."</p>

<p>Horace nodded. He turned to consult with his trainer. If the
baronet decided to run the dead-heat off, there was nothing to
prevent it, the laws of racing being that both owners must agree
to divide.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac announced his intention to the stewards, and it was
arranged that the run-off would take place after the last race of
the day.</p>

<p>He was shaking with excitement when he rejoined Black. "I'm
not so sure that you're right," he said dubiously. "This chap
Gresham says his horse was boxed in. I didn't see the beast in
the race, so I can't tell. Ask somebody."</p>

<p>"Don't worry," said Black, patting him on the back, "there is
nothing to worry about; you'll win this race just as easily as I
shall walk from this ring to the paddock."</p>

<p>Sir Isaac was not satisfied. He waited till he saw a
journalist whom he knew by sight returning from the telegraph
office.</p>

<p>"I say," he said, "did you see the race?"</p>

<p>The journalist nodded. "Yes, Sir Isaac," he said with a smile.
"I suppose Gresham insisted on running it off?"</p>

<p>"No, he didn't," said Sir Isaac, "but I think I was unlucky to
lose."</p>

<p>The journalist made a little grimace. "I'm sorry I can't agree
with you," he said. "I thought that Mr. Gresham's horse ought to
have won easily, but that he was boxed in in the straight."</p>

<p>Sir Isaac reported this conversation to Black.</p>

<p>"Take no notice of these racing journalists," said Black
contemptuously. "What do they know? Haven't I got eyes as well as
they?"</p>

<p>But this did not satisfy Sir Isaac. "These chaps are jolly
good judges," he said. "I wish to heaven I had divided."</p>

<p>Black slapped him on the shoulder. "You're losing your nerve,
Ikey," he said. "Why, you'll be thanking me at dinner tonight for
having saved you thousands of pounds. He didn't want to run it
off?"</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Sir Isaac. "Gresham?"</p>

<p>"Yes; did he?" asked Black.</p>

<p>"No, he wasn't very keen. He said it wasn't fair to the
horses."</p>

<p>Black laughed. "Rubbish!" he said scornfully. "Do you imagine
a man like that cares whether his horse is hard raced or whether
it isn't? No! He saw the race as well as I did. He saw that your
fool of a jockey had it won and was caught napping. Of course he
didn't want to risk a run-off. I tell you that Timbolino will win
easily."</p>

<p>Somewhat reassured by his companion's optimism. Sir Isaac
awaited the conclusion of the run-off in better spirits. It added
to his assurance that the ring took a similar view to that which
Black held. They were asking for odds about Timbolino. You might
have got two to one against Nemesis.</p>

<p>But only for a little while. Gresham had gone into the
tea-room with the girl, and was standing at the narrow entrance of
the county stand, when the cry, "Two to one Nemesis!" caught his
ear.</p>

<p>"They're not laying against my horse!" he exclaimed in
astonishment. He beckoned a man who was passing. "Are they laying
against Nemesis?" he asked. The man nodded. He was a commission
agent, who did whatever work the young owner required. "Go in and
back her for me. Put in as much money as you possibly can get.
Back it down to evens," said Gresham decidedly.</p>

<p>He was not a gambling man. He was shrewd and business-like in
all his transactions, and he could read a race. He knew exactly
what had happened. His money created some sensation in a market
which was not over-strong. Timbolino went out, and Nemesis was a
shade odds on.</p>

<p>Then it was that money came in for Sir Isaac's horse.</p>

<p>Black did not bet to any extent, but he saw a chance of making
easy money. The man honestly believed all he had said to Sir
Isaac. He was confident in his mind that the jockey had ridden a
"jolly race." He had sufficient credit amongst the best men in
the ring to invest fairly heavily.</p>

<p>Again the market experienced an extraordinary change.
Timbolino was favourite again. Nemesis went out&mdash;first six
to four, then two to one, then five to two.</p>

<p>But now the money began to come in from the country. The
results of the race and its description had been published in the
stop-press editions in hundreds of evening papers up and down
England, Ireland and Scotland. Quick to make their decisions, the
little punters of Great Britain were re-investing&mdash;some to
save their stakes, others to increase what they already regarded
as their winnings.</p>

<p>And here the money was for Nemesis. The reporters,
unprejudiced, had no other interest but to secure for the public
accurate news and to describe things as they saw them. And the
race as they saw it was the race which Sir Isaac would not
believe and at which Black openly scoffed.</p>

<p>The last event was set for half-past four, and after the field
had come past the post, and the winner was being led to the
unsaddling enclosure, the two dead-heaters of the memorable
Lincolnshire Handicap came prancing from the paddock on to the
course.</p>

<p>The question of the draw was immaterial. There was nothing to
choose between the jockeys, two experienced horsemen, and there
was little delay at the post. It does not follow that a race of
two runners means an equable start, though it seemed that nothing
was likely to interfere with the tiny field getting off together.
When the tapes went up, however, Nemesis half-turned and lost a
couple of lengths.</p>

<p>"I'll back Timbolino," yelled somebody from the ring, and a
quick staccato voice cried, "I'll take three to one."</p>

<p>A chorus of acceptances met the offer.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac was watching the race from the public stand. Black
was at his side.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you?" asked the latter exultantly. "The money
is in your pocket, Ikey, my boy. Look, three lengths in front.
You'll win at a walk."</p>

<p>The boy on Nemesis had her well balanced. He did not drive her
out. He seemed content to wait those three lengths in the rear.
Gresham, watching them through his glasses, nodded his
approval.</p>

<p>"They're going no pace," he said to the man at his side. "She
was farther behind at this point in the race itself."</p>

<p>Both horses were running smoothly. At the five-furlong post
the lad on Nemesis let the filly out just a little. Without any
apparent effort she improved her position. The jockey knew now
exactly what were his resources and he was content to wait
behind. The rest of the race needs very little description. It
was a procession until they had reached the distance. Then the
boy on Timbolino looked round.</p>

<p>"He's beaten," said Gresham, half to himself. He knew that
some jockeys looked round when they felt their mount failing
under them.</p>

<p>Two hundred yards from the post Nemesis, with scarcely an
effort, drew level with the leader. Out came the other jockey's
whip. One, two, he landed his mount, and the horse went ahead
till he was a neck in front. Then, coming up with one long run,
Nemesis first drew up, then passed the fast-stopping Timbolino,
and won with consummate ease by a length and a half.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac could not believe his eyes. He gasped, dropped his
glasses, and stared at the horses in amazement. It was obvious
that he was beaten long before the winning-post was reached.</p>

<p>"He's pulling the horse," he cried, beside himself with rage
and chagrin. "Look at him! I'll have him before the stewards. He
is not riding the horse!"</p>

<p>Black's hand closed on his arm. "Drop it, you fool," he
muttered. "Are you going to give away the fact that you are broke
to the world before all these people? You're beaten fairly
enough. I've lost as much as you have. Get out of this."</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Tramber went down the stairs of the grand-stand in
the midst of a throng of people, all talking at once in different
keys. He was dazed. He was more like a man in a dream. He could
not realize what it meant to him. He was stunned, bewildered. All
that he knew was that Timbolino had lost. He had a vague idea at
the back of his mind that he was a ruined man, and only a faint
ray of hope that Black would in some mysterious way get him out
of his trouble.</p>

<p>"The horse was pulled," he repeated dully. "He couldn't have
lost. Black, wasn't it pulled?"</p>

<p>"Shut up," snarled the other. "You're going to get yourself
into pretty bad trouble unless you control that tongue of yours."
He got the shaking man away from the course and put a stiff glass
of brandy and water in his hand. The baronet awoke to his tragic
position.</p>

<p>"I can't pay, Black." he wailed. "I can't pay&mdash;what an
awful business for me. What a fool I was to take your
advice&mdash;what a fool! Curse you, you were standing in with
Gresham. Why did you advise me? What did you make out of it?"</p>

<p>"Dry up," said Black shortly. "You're like a babe, Ikey. What
are you worrying about? I've told you I've lost as much money as
you. Now we've got to sit down and think out a plan for making
money. What have you lost?"</p>

<p>Sir Isaac shook his head weakly. "I don't know," he said
listlessly. "Six or seven thousand pounds. I haven't got six or
seven thousand pence," he added plaintively. "It's a pretty bad
business for me, Black. A man in my position&mdash;I shall have
to sell off my horses&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your position!" Black laughed harshly. "My dear good chap, I
shouldn't let that worry you. Your reputation," he went on.
"You're living in a fool's paradise, my man," he said with savage
banter. "Why, you've no more reputation than I have. Who cares
whether you pay your debts of honour or whether you don't? It
would surprise people more if you paid than if you defaulted. Get
all that nonsense out of your head and think sensibly. You will
make all you've lost and much more. You've got to marry&mdash;and
quick, and then she's got to inherit my lord's money, almost as
quickly."</p>

<p>Ikey looked at him in despairing amazement. "Even if she
married me," he said pettishly, "I should have to wait years for
the money." Colonel Black smiled.</p>

<p>They were moving off the course when they were overtaken by a
man, who touched the baronet on the arm.</p>

<p>"Excuse me. Sir Isaac," he said, and handed him an
envelope.</p>

<p>"For me?" asked Ikey wonderingly, and opened the envelope.
There was no letter&mdash;only a slip of paper and four
bank-notes for a thousand pounds each. Sir Isaac gasped and
read:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">Pay your debts and live cleanly; avoid Black
like the devil and work for your living.</p>

<br>

<p>The writing was disguised, but the language was obviously Lord
Verlond's.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap13" id="chap13">XIII.&mdash;WHO ARE THE
FOUR?</a></h2>

<p class="first">LORD VERLOND sat at breakfast behind an open
copy of The Times. Breakfast was ever an unsociable meal at
Verlond House. Lady Mary, in her neat morning dress, was content
to read her letters and her papers without expecting conversation
from the old man.</p>

<p>He looked across at her. His face was thoughtful. In repose
she had always thought it rather fine, and now his grave eyes
were watching her with an expression she did not remember having
seen before.</p>

<p>"Mary," he asked abruptly, "are you prepared for a shock?"</p>

<p>She smiled, though somewhat uneasily. These shocks were often
literal facts. "I think I can survive it," she said.</p>

<p>There was a long pause, during which his eyes did not leave
her face. "Would you be startled to know that that young demon of
a brother of yours is still alive?"</p>

<p>"Alive!" she exclaimed, starting to her feet. There was no
need for the old man to ask exactly how she viewed the news. Her
face was flushed with pleasure&mdash;joy shone in her eyes. "Oh,
is it really true?" she cried.</p>

<p>"It's true enough," said the old man moodily. "Very curious
how things turn out. I thought the young beggar was dead, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't talk like that, uncle, you don't mean it."</p>

<p>"I mean it all right," snapped the earl. "Why shouldn't I? He
was infernally rude to me. Do you know what he called me before
he left?"</p>

<p>"But that was sixteen years ago," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Sixteen grandmothers," said the old man. "It doesn't make any
difference to me if it was sixteen hundred years&mdash;he still
said it. He called me a tiresome old bore&mdash;what do you think
of that?" She laughed, and a responsive gleam came to the old
man's face. "It's all very well for you to laugh," he said, "but
it's rather a serious business for a member of the House of Lords
to be called a tiresome old bore by a youthful Etonian.
Naturally, remembering his parting words and the fact that he had
gone to America, added to the very important fact that I am a
Churchman and a regular subscriber to Church institutions, I
thought he was dead. After all, one expects some reward from an
All-wise Providence."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the earl. "I traced him to
Texas&mdash;apparently he was on a farm there until he was
twenty-one. After that his movements seem to have been somewhat
difficult to trace."</p>

<p>"Why," she said suddenly, pointing an accusing finger at him,
"you've been trying to trace him."</p>

<p>For a fraction of a second the old man looked confused. "I've
done nothing of the sort," he snarled. "Do you think I'd spend my
money to trace a rascal who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you have," she went on. "I know you have. Why do you
pretend to be such an awful old man?"</p>

<p>"Anyway, I think he's found out," he complained. "It takes
away a great deal of the fortune which would have come to you. I
don't suppose Gresham will want you now." She smiled. He rose
from the table and went to the door. "Tell that infernal
villain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which one?"</p>

<p>"James," he replied, "that I'm not to be disturbed. I'm going
to my study. I'm not to be disturbed by anyone for any reason; do
you understand?"</p>

<p>If it was a busy morning for his lordship, it was no less so
for Black and his friend, for it was Monday, and settling day,
and in numerous clubs in London expectant bookmakers, in whose
volumes the names of Black and Sir Isaac were freely inscribed,
examined their watches with feelings that bordered upon
apprehension.</p>

<p>But, to the surprise of everybody who knew the men, the
settlements were made. An accession of wealth had come to the
"firm."</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Tramber spent that afternoon pleasantly. He was
raised from the depths of despair to the heights of exaltation.
His debts of honour were paid; he felt it was possible for him to
look the world in the face. As a taxi drove him swiftly to
Black's office, he was whistling gaily, and smiling at the
politely veiled surprise of one of his suspicious bookmakers.</p>

<p>The big man was not at his office, and Sir Isaac, who had
taken the precaution of instructing his driver to wait,
re-directed him to the Chelsea flat. Black was dressing for dinner
when Sir Isaac arrived.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he said, motioning him to a seat. "You're the man I
want. I've got a piece of information that will please you. You
are the sort of chap who is scared by these Four Just Men. Well,
you needn't be any more. I've found out all about them. It's cost
me £200 to make the discovery, but it's worth every penny." He
looked at a sheet of paper lying before him. "Here is the list of
their names. A curious collection, eh? You wouldn't suspect a
Wesleyan of taking such steps as these chaps have taken. A bank
manager in South London&mdash;Mr. Charles Grimburd&mdash;you've
heard of him: he's the art connoisseur, an unexpected person, eh?
And Wilkinson Despard&mdash;he's the fellow I suspected most of
all. I've been watching the papers very carefully. The Post
Herald, the journal he writes for, has always been very well
informed upon these outrages of the Four. They seem to know more
about it than any other paper, and then, in addition, this man
Despard has been writing pretty vigorously on social problems.
He's got a place in Jermyn Street. I put a man on to straighten
his servant, who had been betting. He had lost money. My man has
been at him for a couple of weeks. There they are." He tossed the
sheet across. "Less awe-inspiring than when they stick to their
masks and their funny titles."</p>

<p>Sir Isaac studied the list with interest.</p>

<p>"But there are only three here," he said. "Who is the
fourth?"</p>

<p>"The fourth is the leader: can't you guess who it is? Gresham,
of course."</p>

<p>"Gresham?"</p>

<p>"I haven't any proof," said Black; "it's only surmise. But I
would stake all I have in the world that I'm right. He is the
very type of man to be in this&mdash;to organize it, to arrange
the details."</p>

<p>"Are you sure the fourth is Gresham?" asked Sir Isaac
again.</p>

<p>"Pretty sure," said Black. He had finished his dressing and
was brushing his dress-coat carefully with a whisk brush.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Sir Isaac.</p>

<p>"I have a little business to-night," replied the other. "I
don't think it would interest you very much." He stopped his
brushing. For a moment he seemed deep in thought. "On
consideration," he said slowly, "perhaps it will interest you.
Come along to the office with me. Have you dined?"</p>

<p>"No, not yet."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I can't dine you," said Black. "I have an important
engagement after this which is taking all my attention at
present. You're not dressed," he continued. "That's good. We're
going to a place where people do not as a rule dress for
dinner"</p>

<p>Over his own evening suit he drew a long overcoat, which he
buttoned to the neck. He selected a soft felt hat from the
wardrobe in the room and put it on before the looking-glass.
"Now, come along," he said.</p>

<p>It was dusk, and the wind which howled through the deserted
street justified the wrapping he had provided. He did not
immediately call a cab, but walked until they came to Vauxhall
Bridge Road. By this time Sir Isaac's patience and powers of
pedestrianism were almost exhausted.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" he said irritably, "this is not the kind of job I
like particularly."</p>

<p>"Have a little patience," said Black. "You don't expect me to
call cabs in Chelsea and give my directions for half a dozen
people to hear. You don't seem to realize, Ikey, that you and I
are being very closely watched."</p>

<p>"Well, they could be watching us now," said Sir Isaac with
truth.</p>

<p>"They may be, but the chances are that nobody will be near
enough when we give directions to the driver as to our exact
destination."</p>

<p>Even Sir Isaac did not catch it, so low was the voice of Black
instructing the driver. Through the little pane at the back of
the cab Black scrutinized the vehicles following their route. "I
don't think there is anybody after us at present," he said. "It
isn't a very important matter, but if the information came to the
Four that their plans were being checkmated it might make it
rather awkward for us."</p>

<p>The cab passed down the winding road which leads from the Oval
to Kennington Green. It threaded a way through the traffic and
struck the Camberwell Road. Half-way down, Black put out his
head, and the cab turned sharply to the left. Then he tapped at
the window and it stopped. He got out, followed by Sir Isaac.
"Just wait for me at the end of the street," he said to the
driver.</p>

<p>He handed the man some money as a guarantee of his bona fides,
and the two moved off. The street was one of very poor artisan
houses, and Black had recourse to an electric lamp which he
carried in his pocket to discover the number he wanted. At last
he came to a small house with a tiny patch of garden in front and
knocked. A little girl opened the door. "Is Mr. Farmer in?" said
Black.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the little girl, "will you go up?"</p>

<p>She led the way up the carpeted stairs and knocked at a small
door on the left. A voice bade them come in. The two men entered.
Seated by the table in a poorly-furnished room, lit only by the
fire, was a man. He rose as they entered.</p>

<p>"I must explain," said Black, "that Mr. Farmer has rented this
room for a couple of weeks. He only comes here occasionally to
meet his friends. This," he went on, motioning to Sir Isaac, "is
a great friend of mine."</p>

<p>He closed the door, and waited till the little girl's
footsteps on the stairs had died away.</p>

<p>"The advantage of meeting in this kind of house," said the man
called Farmer, "is that the slightest movement shakes the edifice
from roof to basement."</p>

<p>He spoke with what might be described as a "mock-culture"
voice. It was the voice of a common man who had been much in the
company of gentlemen, and who endeavoured to imitate their
intonation without attempting to acquire their vocabulary.</p>

<p>"You can speak freely, Mr. Farmer," said Black. "This
gentleman is in my confidence. We are both interested in this
ridiculous organization. I understand you have now left Mr.
Wilkinson Despard's employment?"</p>

<p>The man nodded. "Yes, sir," he said, with a little embarrassed
cough. "I left him yesterday."</p>

<p>"Now, have you found out who the fourth is?"</p>

<p>The man hesitated. "I am not sure, sir. It is only fair to
tell you that I am not absolutely certain. But I think you could
gamble on the fact that the fourth gentleman is Mr. Horace
Gresham."</p>

<p>"You didn't say that," said Black, "until I suggested the name
myself."</p>

<p>The man did not flinch at the suspicion involved in the
comment. His voice was even as he replied: "That I admit, sir.
But the other three gentlemen I knew. I had nothing to do with
the fourth. He used to come to Mr. Despard's late at night, and I
admitted him. I never saw his face and never heard his voice. He
went straight to Mr. Despard's study, and if you knew how the
house was portioned out you would realize that it was next to
impossible to hear anything!"</p>

<p>"How did you come to know that these men were the Four?" asked
Black.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said the other, obviously ill at ease, "by the
way servants generally find things out&mdash;I listened."</p>

<p>"And yet you never found out who the leader was?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you discovered anything else of which I am not
aware?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the man eagerly. "I discovered before I left
Mr. Despard's employ that they've got you set. That's an old army
term which means that they've marked you down for
punishment."</p>

<p>"Oh, they have, have they?" said Black.</p>

<p>"I overheard that last night. You see, the meeting generally
consisted of four. The fourth very seldom turned up unless there
was something to do. But he was always the leading spirit. It was
he who found the money when money was necessary. It was he who
directed the Four to their various occupations. And it was he who
invariably chose the people who had to be punished. He has chosen
you, I know, sir. They had a meeting, the night before last. They
were discussing various people, and I heard your name."</p>

<p>"How could you hear?"</p>

<p>"I was in the next room, sir. There's a dressing-room leading
out of Mr. Despard's room, where these conferences were held. I
had a duplicate key."</p>

<p>Black rose as if to go.</p>

<p>"It almost seems a pity you have left that Johnnie. Did they
ever speak about me?" asked Sir Isaac, who had been an attentive
listener.</p>

<p>"I don't know your name, sir," said the servant
deferentially.</p>

<p>"No, and you jolly well won't," answered the baronet
promptly.</p>

<p>"I hope, gentlemen," said the man, "that now I have lost my
employment you'll do whatever you can to find me another place.
If either of you gentlemen want a reliable man-servant&mdash;"</p>

<p>He looked inquiringly at Sir Isaac, as being the more likely
of the two.</p>

<p>"Not me," said the other brutally. "I find all my work cut out
to keep my own secrets, without having any dam' eavesdropping man
on the premises to spy on me."</p>

<p>The man against whom this was directed did not seem
particularly hurt by the bluntness of the other. He merely bowed
his head and made no reply.</p>

<p>Black took a flat case from his inside pocket, opened it and
extracted two notes.</p>

<p>"Here are twenty pounds," he said, "which makes £220 you have
had from me. Now, if you can find out anything else worth knowing
I don't mind making it up to £300&mdash;but it has got to be
something good. Keep in with the servants. You know the rest of
them. Is there any reason why you shouldn't go back to the
flat?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the man. "I was merely discharged for
carelessness."</p>

<p>"Very good," said Black. "You know my address and where to
find me. If anything turns up let me know."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"By the way," said Black, as he made a move to go, "do the
Four contemplate taking any action in the immediate future?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the man eagerly. "I am particularly sure of
that. I heard them discussing the advisability of parting. One
gentleman wanted to go to the Continent for a month, and another
wanted to go to America to see about his mining property. By the
way, they all agreed there was no necessity to meet for a month.
I gathered that for the time being they were doing nothing."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" said Black. He shook hands with the servant and
departed.</p>

<p>"Pretty beastly sort of man to have about the house," said Sir
Isaac as they walked back to the cab.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Black, good-humouredly, "but it isn't my house,
and I feel no scruples in the matter. I do not," he added
virtuously, "approve of tapping servants for information about
their masters and mistresses, but there are occasions when this
line of conduct is perfectly justified."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap14" id="chap14">XIV.&mdash;WILLIE JAKOBS
TELLS</a></h2>

<p class="first">LEFT alone, the man whom they had called Farmer
waited a few minutes. Then he took down his coat, which hung
behind the door, put on his hat and gloves deliberately and
thoughtfully, and left the house. He walked in the direction
which Black and Sir Isaac had taken, but their taxi-cab was
flying northward long before he reached the spot where it had
waited.</p>

<p>He pursued his way into the Camberwell Road and boarded a
tram-car. The street lamps and the lights in the shop windows
revealed him to be a good-looking man, a little above the average
height, with a pale refined face. He was dressed quietly, but
well.</p>

<p>He alighted near the Elephant and Castle and strode rapidly
along the New Kent Road, turning into one of the poorer streets
which lead to a labyrinth of smaller and more poverty-stricken
thoroughfares in that district which is bounded on the west by
East Street and on the east by the New Kent Road. A little way
along, some of the old houses had been pulled down and new
buildings in yellow brick had been erected. A big red lamp
outside a broad entrance notified the neighbourhood that this was
the free dispensary, though none who lived within a radius of
five miles needed any information as to the existence of this
institution.</p>

<p>In the hall-way was a board containing the names of three
doctors, and against them a little sliding panel, which enabled
them to inform their visitors whether they were in or out. He
paused before the board.</p>

<p>The little indicator against the first name said "Out."</p>

<p>Farmer put up his hand and slid the panel along to show the
word "In." Then he passed through the door, through the large
waiting-room into a small room, which bore the name "Dr. Wilson
Graille."</p>

<p>He closed the door behind him and slipped a catch. He took off
his hat and coat and hung them up. Then he touched a bell, and a
servant appeared.</p>

<p>"Is Dr. O'Hara in?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, doctor," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Ask him to come along to me, will you, please?"</p>

<p>In a few minutes a man of middle height, but powerfully built,
came in and closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>"Well, how did you get on?" he inquired, and, uninvited, drew
up a chair to the table.</p>

<p>"They jumped at the bait," said Gonsalez with a little laugh.
"I think they have got something on. They were most anxious to
know whether we were moving at all. You had better notify
Manfred. We'll have a meeting to-night. What about Despard? Do
you think he would object to having his name used?"</p>

<p>His voice lacked the mock culture which had so deceived
Black.</p>

<p>"Not a bit. I chose him purposely because I knew he was going
abroad to-night."</p>

<p>"And the others?"</p>

<p>"With the exception of the art man, they are non-existent."</p>

<p>"Suppose he investigates?"</p>

<p>"Not he. He will be satisfied to take the most prominent of
the four&mdash;Despard, and the other chap whose name I have
forgotten. Despard leaves to-night, and the other on Wednesday
for America. You see, that fits in with what I told Black."</p>

<p>He took from his pocket the two ten-pound notes and laid them
on the table. "Twenty pounds," he said, and handed them to the
other man. "You ought to be able to do something with that."</p>

<p>The other stuffed them into his waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>"I shall send those two Brady children to the seaside," he
said. "It probably won't save their lives, but it will give the
little devils some conception of what joy life holds&mdash;for a
month or so." The same thought seemed to occur to both, and they
laughed.</p>

<p>"Black would not like to know to what base use his good money
is being put," said Graille, or Farmer, or Gonsalez&mdash;call
him what you will&mdash;with a twinkle in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Were they anxious to know who was the fourth man?" asked
Poiccart.</p>

<p>"Most keen on it," he said. "But I wondered if they would have
believed me if I had confessed myself to be one of the four, and
had I at the same time confessed that I was as much in the dark
as to the identity of the fourth as they themselves."</p>

<p>Poiccart rose and stood irresolutely, with his hands stuffed
into his trousers pockets, looking into the fire.</p>

<p>"I often wonder," he said, "who it is. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"I've got over those sensations of curiosity," said Gonsalez.
"Whoever he is, I am of course satisfied that he is a
large-hearted man, working with a singleness of purpose."</p>

<p>The other nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>"I am sure," said Graille enthusiastically, "that he has done
great work, justifiable work, and honourable work."</p>

<p>Poiccart nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"By the way," said the other, "I went to old Lord
Verlond&mdash;you remember, No. 4 suggested our trying him. He's
a pretty bitter sort of person with a sharp tongue."</p>

<p>Poiccart smiled. "What did he do? Tell you to go to the
devil?"</p>

<p>"Something of the sort," said Dr. Gonsalez. "I only got a
grudging half-guinea from him, and he regaled me all the time
with more than half a guinea's worth of amusement."</p>

<p>"But it wasn't for this work," said the other.</p>

<p>Gonsalez shook his head. "No, for another department," he said
with a smile.</p>

<p>They had little more time for conversation. Patients began to
come in, and within a quarter of an hour the two men were as busy
as men could be attending to the injuries, the diseases and the
complaints of the people of this overcrowded neighbourhood.</p>

<p>This great dispensary owed its erection and its continuance to
the munificence of three doctors who appeared from nowhere. Who
the man was who had contributed £5,000 to the upkeep, and who had
afterwards appeared in person, masked and cloaked, and had
propounded to three earnest workers for humanity his desire to be
included in the organization, nobody knew, unless it was Manfred.
It was Manfred the wise who accepted not only the offer, but the
bona fides of the stranger&mdash;Manfred who accepted him as a
co-partner.</p>

<p>Casual observers described the three earnest medicos not only
as cranks, but fanatics. They were attached to no organization;
they gave no sign to the world that they could be in any way
associated with any of the religious organizations engaged in
medical work. It is an indisputable fact that they possessed the
qualifications to practise, and that one&mdash;Leon
Gonsalez&mdash;was in addition a brilliant chemist.</p>

<p>No man ever remembered their going to church, or urging
attendance at any place of worship. The religious bodies that
laboured in the neighbourhood were themselves astonished. One by
one they had nibbled at the sectarian question. Some had asked
directly to what religious organization these men were attached.
No answer was offered satisfactory to the inquirers.</p>

<p>It was nearly eleven o'clock that night when the work of the
two dispensers had finished. The last patient had been dismissed,
the last fretful whimper of an ailing child had died away; the
door had been locked, the sweepers were engaged in cleaning up
the big waiting-room.</p>

<p>The two men sat in the office&mdash;tired, but cheerful. The
room was well furnished; it was the common room of the three. A
bright fire burnt in the fire-place, big roomy arm-chairs and
settees were in evidence. The floor was carpeted thickly, and two
or three rare prints hung on the distempered walls.</p>

<p>They were sitting discussing the events of the
evening&mdash;comparing notes, retailing particulars of interest
in cases which had come under their notice. Manfred had gone out
earlier in the evening and had not returned. Then a bell rang
shrilly. Leon looked up at the indicator. "That is the dispensary
door," he said in Spanish. "I suppose we'd better see who it
is."</p>

<p>"It will be a small girl," said Poiccart. "'Please will you
come to father; he's either dead or drunk.'" There was a little
laugh at this reminiscence of an incident which had actually
happened.</p>

<p>Poiccart opened the door. A man stood in the entrance.
"There's a bad accident just round the corner," he said. "Can I
bring him in here, doctor?"</p>

<p>"What sort of an accident?" said Poiccart.</p>

<p>"A man has been knifed."</p>

<p>"Bring him in," said Poiccart. He went quickly to the common
room. "It's a stabbing case," he said. "Will you have him in your
surgery, Leon?"</p>

<p>The young man rose swiftly. "Yes," he said; "I'll get the
table ready."</p>

<p>In a few minutes half a dozen men bore in the unconscious form
of the victim. It was a face familiar to the two. They laid him
tenderly upon the surgical table, and with deft hands ripped away
the clothing from the wound, whilst the policeman who had
accompanied the party pushed back the crowd from the surgery
door.</p>

<p>The two men were alone with the unconscious man. They
exchanged glances.</p>

<p>"Unless I am mistaken" said carefully, "this is the late Mr.
Willie Jakobs."</p>

<p>That evening May Sandford sat alone in her room reading. Her
father, when he had come in to say good-bye to May before going
to a directors' dinner, had left her ostensibly studying an
improving book, but the volume now lay unheeded at her side.</p>

<p>That afternoon she had received an urgent note from Black,
asking her to meet him "on a matter of the greatest importance."
It concerned her father, and it was very secret. She was alarmed,
and not a little puzzled. The urgency and the secrecy of the note
distressed her unaccountably. For the twentieth time she began to
read the improving plays of Monsieur Moliere, when a knock at the
door made her hastily conceal the paper.</p>

<p>"There is a man who wishes to see you," said the girl who had
entered in response to her "Come in."</p>

<p>"What sort of man?"</p>

<p>"A common-looking man," said the maid.</p>

<p>She hesitated. The butler was in the house, otherwise she
would not have seen the visitor.</p>

<p>"Show him into father's study," she said. "Tell Thomas this
man is here and ask him to be handy in case I ring for him."</p>

<p>She had never seen the man whom she found waiting.
Instinctively she distrusted his face, though there was something
about him which compelled her sympathy. He was white and haggard,
black shadows encircled his eyes, and his hands, by no means
clean, shook.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to bother you, miss," he said, "but this is
important."</p>

<p>"It is rather a late hour," she said. "What is it you
want?"</p>

<p>He fumbled with his hat and looked at the waiting girl. At a
nod from May she left the room.</p>

<p>"This is rather important to you, miss," said the man again.
"Black treated me pretty badly."</p>

<p>For a moment an unworthy suspicion flashed through her mind.
Had Frank sent his man to her to shake her faith in Black? A
feeling of resentment arose against her visitor and the man she
thought was his employer.</p>

<p>"You may save your breath," she said coolly, "and you can go
back to the gentleman who sent you and tell him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nobody sent me, miss," he said eagerly. "I come on my own. I
tell you they've done me a bad turn. I've kept my mouth shut for
Black for years, and now he's turned me down. I'm ill, miss, you
can see that for yourself," he said, throwing out his arms in
despair. "I've been almost starving and they haven't given me a
bean. I went to Black's house to-day and he wouldn't see me." He
almost whimpered in his helpless anger. "He's done me a bad turn
and I'm going to do him one," he said fiercely. "You know what
his game is?"</p>

<p>"I do not want to know," she said again, the old suspicion
obscuring her vision. "You will gain nothing by speaking against
Colonel Black."</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish, miss," he pleaded, "don't think I've come
for money. I don't expect money&mdash;I don't want it. I dare say
I can get help from Mr. Fellowe."</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said, "so you know Mr. Fellowe: it was he who sent
you. I will not hear another word," she went on hotly. "I know
now where you come from&mdash;I've heard all this before."</p>

<p>She walked determinedly across the room and rang the bell. The
butler came in. "Show this man out," said May.</p>

<p>The man looked at her sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"You've had your chance, miss," he said ominously. "Black's
Essley, that's all!"</p>

<p>With this parting shot he shuffled through the hall, down the
steps into the night.</p>

<p>Left alone, the girl shrank into her chair. She was shaking
from head to foot with indignation and bewilderment. It must have
been Frank who sent this man. How mean, how inexpressibly
mean!</p>

<p>"How dare he? How dare he?" she asked.</p>

<p>It was the policeman in Frank which made him so horrid, she
thought. He always believed horrid things of everybody. It was
only natural. He had lived his life amongst criminals; he had
thought of nothing but breaches of the law. She looked at the
dock: it was a quarter to ten. He had wasted her evening, this
visitor. She did not know exactly what to do. She could not read;
it was too early to go to bed. She would have liked to have gone
for a little walk, but there was nobody to take her. It was
absurd asking the butler to walk behind her; she smiled at the
thought.</p>

<p>Then she started. She had heard the distant ring of the
front-door bell. Who could it be?</p>

<p>She had not long to wait in doubt. A few minutes afterwards
the girl had announced Colonel Black. He was in evening dress and
very cheerful.</p>

<p>"Forgive this visit," he said, with that heartiness of voice
which carried conviction of his sincerity. "I happened to be
passing and I thought I'd drop in."</p>

<p>This was not exactly true. Black had carefully planned this
call. He knew her father was out; knew also, so bitter had been a
discussion of that afternoon, that he would not have sanctioned
the visit. May gave him her hand, and he grasped it warmly.</p>

<p>She came straight to the point. "I'm so glad you've come," she
said. "I've been awfully bothered." He nodded sympathetically,
though a little at sea. "And now this man has come?"</p>

<p>"This man&mdash;which man?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"I forget his name&mdash;he came this evening. In fact, he's
only been gone a little time. And he looked awfully ill. You know
him, I think?"</p>

<p>"Not Jakobs?" he breathed.</p>

<p>She nodded. "I think that is the name," she said.</p>

<p>"Jakobs?" he repeated, and his face went a little white. "What
did he say?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>She repeated the conversation as nearly as she could remember
it. When she had finished he rose. "You're not going?" she said
in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I must," he said. "I've a rather important
engagement and&mdash;er&mdash;I only called in passing. Which way
did this man go? Did he give you any idea as to his
destination?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No. All that he said was that there were
people who would be glad of the information he could give about
you."</p>

<p>"He did, did he?" said Black, with an heroic attempt at a
smile. "I never thought Jakobs was that kind of man. Of course,
there is nothing that I should mind everybody knowing, but one
has business secrets, you know. Miss Sandford. He is a discharged
employee of mine who has stolen some contracts. You need not worry about the matter."</p>

<p>He smiled confidently at her as he left the room.</p>

<p>He drove straight from the house to his city office. The place
was in darkness, but he knew his way without the necessity of
lighting up. He ran upstairs into the boardroom.</p>

<p>There was a little door in one corner of the room, concealed
from view by a hanging curtain.</p>

<p>He closed the shutters and pulled down the blinds before he
switched on the light. He pushed the curtain aside and examined
the face of the door. There was no sign that it had been forced.
Jakobs knew of the existence of this little retiring-room, and
had, in his indiscretion, mentioned its existence in one of his
letters of demand.</p>

<p>Black drew from his pocket a small bunch of keys attached to a
silver chain. The door of the room opened easily. There was a
smaller room disclosed&mdash;no larger than a big cupboard. A
single incandescent electric burner slung from the ceiling
supplied all the light necessary. There was a dressing-table, a
chair, a big looking-glass, and a number of hooks from which were
suspended a dozen articles of attire. Air was admitted through
two ventilators let into the wall and communicating with the main
ventilating shaft of the building.</p>

<p>He opened the door of the dressing-table and drew out a number
of wigs. They were wigs such as only Fasieur can
supply&mdash;perfectly modelled and all of one shade of hair,
though differently arranged.</p>

<p>He tossed them on to the table impatiently, groping for
something which he knew should be there, and was there unless a
thief skilled in the use of skeleton keys, and having, moreover,
some knowledge of the office, had taken it. He stopped his search
suddenly and examined a pad of paper which lay on the table. It
was a pad which he kept handy for note-taking&mdash;to jot down
memoranda. On the white face of the paper was a large brown
thumb-mark, and though Colonel Black knew little of the science
of anthropology, he was sufficiently well acquainted with the
sign to know that it was the mark of a thumb which ought never to
have been in this secret office of his.</p>

<p>Then it was Willie! Willie Jakobs, the befriended, the
pensioned, and the scorned, who had removed a certain green
bottle, the duplicate of which was in his pocket at that
moment.</p>

<p>Black did not lose his nerve. He went to a drawer in the desk
of his outer office and took out a Browning pistol. It was
loaded. He balanced it in his right hand, looked at it
reflectively, then put it back again. He hated firearms; they
made a great deal of unnecessary noise, and they left behind them
too sure an indication of the identity of their user. Men have
been traced by bullets.</p>

<p>There were other ways. He lifted from the drawer a long thin
knife. It was an Italian stiletto of the sixteenth
century&mdash;the sort of toy a man might use in these prosaic
days for opening his letters. And indeed this was the ostensible
reason why Black kept the weapon at hand.</p>

<p>He drew it from its ornate leather sheath and tested its
temper, felt its edge and gingerly fingered its point; then he
put the stiletto in its case in his overcoat pocket, switched out
the light and went out. This was not a case which demanded the
employment of the little bottle. There was too little of the
precious stuff left, and he had need of it for other
purposes.</p>

<p>There were two or three places where he might find the man. A
little public-house off Regent Street was one. He drove there,
stopping the cab a few paces from the spot. He strode into the
bar, where men of Jakobs' kind were to be found, but it was
empty. The man he sought was not there.</p>

<p>He made a tour of other likely places with no better success.
Willie would be at home. He had moved to lodgings on the south
side of the Thames.</p>

<p>It was coming from a little public-house off the New Kent Road
that Black found his man. Willie had been spending the evening
brooding over his grievance, and was on his way home to prepare
for his big adventure when Black clapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Willie," he said.</p>

<p>The man turned round with a start. "Keep your hands off me,"
he said hastily, stumbling against the wall.</p>

<p>"Now, don't be silly," said Black. "Let's talk this matter out
reasonably. You're a reasonable man, aren't you? I've got a cab
waiting round the corner."</p>

<p>"You don't get me into no cabs," said Jakobs. "I've had enough
of you, Black. You've turned round on me. You cast me out like a
dog. Is that the way to treat a pal?"</p>

<p>"You've made a mistake, my friend," said Black smoothly.
"We're all liable to make mistakes. I've made many, and I dare
say you've made a few. Now, let's talk business."</p>

<p>Willie said nothing. He was still suspicious. Once he thought
he saw the other's hand steal to his breast-pocket. He guessed
the motive of the action. This, then, was where the bottle
was.</p>

<p>Black was an adept in the art of cajolery. He knew the weak
places of all the men who had been associated with him. Very
slowly he led the other aimlessly, so it seemed, from one street
to another until they reached a little cul-de-sac. Stables
occupied one side of the tiny street and artisan houses the
other. One street-lamp half-way down showed a dim light.</p>

<p>Willie hesitated. "There's no thoroughfare," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, there is," said Black confidently. "I know this
neighbourhood rather well. Now, there's one thing I want to ask
you, Willie. I'm sure you are feeling more friendly towards me
now, aren't you?"</p>

<p>His hand rested almost affectionately on the other's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"You didn't play the game," persisted the other.</p>

<p>"Let bygones be bygones," said Black. "What I want to know is,
Willie, why did you take the bottle?" He asked the question in a
matter-of-fact tone. He did not raise his voice or give the query
unusual emphasis.</p>

<p>The other man was taken off his guard. "Well, I felt sore," he
said.</p>

<p>"And I suppose," said Black, with gentle reproach, "you're
waiting to hand that bottle to our friend Fellowe?"</p>

<p>"I haven't handed it to anybody yet," said Willie, "but to
tell you the truth&mdash;"</p>

<p>He said no more. The big man's hand suddenly closed round his
throat with a grip like steel. Willie struggled, but he was like
a child in the grasp of the other.</p>

<p>"You dog," breathed Black.</p>

<p>He shook the helpless man violently. Then with his disengaged
hand he whipped the tell-tale phial from the other's pocket and
pushed him against the wall. "And I'll teach you that that's
nothing to what you'll get if you ever come across me again."</p>

<p>Jakobs dropped, white and ghastly, against the wall. "You've
got the bottle, Black." he said, "but I know everything that
you've done with it."</p>

<p>"You do, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, everything," said the other desperately. "You're not
going to cast me off, do you hear? You've got to pension me, same
as you've done other people. I know enough to send you for a
lagging without&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought you did," said Black.</p>

<p>Something glittered in the light of the lamp, and without a
cry Jakobs went down in a huddled heap to the ground.</p>

<p>Black looked round. He wiped the blade of the stiletto
carefully on the coat of the stricken man, carefully replaced the
weapon in its leather case, and examined his own hands with
considerable care for any signs of blood. But these Italian
weapons make small wounds.</p>

<p>He turned and, pulling on his gloves, made his way back to
where the cab was still waiting.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15">XV.&mdash;SIR ISAAC'S
FEARS</a></h2>

<p class="first">UNDER the bright light of a bronze lamp, all
that was mortal of Jakobs lay extended upon the operating-table.
About the body moved swiftly the shirt-sleeved figures of the
doctors.</p>

<p>"I don't think there is much we can do for him," said
Gonsalez. "He's had an arterial perforation. It seems to me that
he's bleeding internally."</p>

<p>They had made a superficial examination of the wound, and
Poiccart had taken so serious a view of the man's condition that
he had dispatched a messenger for a magistrate. Willie was
conscious during the examination, but he was too weak and too
exhausted to give any account of what had happened.</p>

<p>"There's just a chance," said Poiccart, "if we could get a
J.P. up in time, that we could give him sufficient strychnine to
enable him to tell us who had done this."</p>

<p>"It's murder, I think," said Gonsalez, "the cut's a clean one.
Look, there's hardly half an inch of wound. The man who did this
used a stiletto, I should say, and used it pretty scientifically.
It's a wonder he wasn't killed on the spot."</p>

<p>The hastily-summoned justice of the peace appeared on the
scene much sooner than they had anticipated. Gonsalez explained
the condition of the man.</p>

<p>"He tried to tell me, after we had got him on the table, who
had done it," he said, "but I couldn't catch the name."</p>

<p>"Do you know him?" asked the J.P.</p>

<p>"I know him," he said, "and I've rather an idea as to who has
done it, but I can't give any reasons for my suspicions."</p>

<p>Jakobs was unconscious, and Gonsalez seized the first
opportunity that presented itself of consulting with his
colleague.</p>

<p>"I believe this is Black's work," he said hurriedly. "Why not
send for him? We know Jakobs has been in his employ and was
pensioned by him, and that's sufficient excuse. Possibly, if we
can get him down before this poor chap dies, we shall learn
something."</p>

<p>"I'll get on the telephone," said the other.</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket a memorandum book and consulted its
pages. Black's movements and his resorts were fairly well
tabulated, but the telephone failed to connect the man they
wanted.</p>

<p>At a quarter to two in the morning Jakobs died, without having
regained consciousness, and it looked as though yet another
mystery had been added to a list which was already appallingly
large.</p>

<p>The news came to May Sandford that afternoon. The tragedy had
occurred too late that night to secure descriptions in the
morning papers; but from the earlier editions of the afternoon
journals she read with a shock of the man's terrible fate.</p>

<p>It was only by accident that she learnt of it from this
source, for she was still reading of his death in the paper when
Black, ostentatiously agitated, called upon her. "Isn't it
dreadful. Miss Sandford?" he said.</p>

<p>He was quite beside himself with grief, the girl thought. "I
shall give evidence, of course, but I shall take great care to
keep your name out of it. I think the poor man had very bad
associates indeed," he said frankly. "I had to discharge him for
that reason. Nobody need know he ever came here," he suggested.
"It wouldn't be pleasant for you to be dragged into a sordid case
like this."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no," she said. "I don't want to be mixed up in it at
all. I'm awfully sorry, but I can't see how my evidence would
help."</p>

<p>"Of course," agreed Black. It had only occurred to him that
morning how damning might be the evidence that this girl was in a
position to give, and he had come to her in a panic lest she had
already volunteered it. She thought he looked ill and worried, as
indeed he was, for Black had slept very little that night. He
knew that he was safe from detection. None had seen him meet the
man, and although he had visited the resorts which the man
frequented, he had not inquired after him.</p>

<p>Yet Black was obsessed by the knowledge that a net was drawing
round him. Who were the hunters he could not guess. There came to
him at odd moments a strange feeling of terror. Nothing was going
exactly right with him. Sir Isaac had showed signs of revolt.</p>

<p>Before the day was out he found that he had quite enough to
bother him without the terrors which the unknown held. The police
had made most strenuous inquiries regarding his whereabouts on
the night of the murder. They had even come to him and questioned
him with such persistence that he suspected a directing force
behind them. He had not bothered overmuch with the Four Just Men.
He had accepted the word of his informant that the Four had
separated for the time being, and the fact that Wilkinson Despard
had left for America confirmed all that the man had told him.</p>

<p>He was getting short of money again. The settlement of his
bets had left him short. Sandford must be "persuaded." Every day
it was getting more and more of a necessity. One morning Sir
Isaac had telephoned him asking him to meet him in the park.</p>

<p>"Why not come here?" asked Black.</p>

<p>"No," said the baronet's voice. "I'd rather meet you in the
park."</p>

<p>He named the spot, and at the hour Black met him, a little
annoyed that his day's programme should be interrupted by this
eccentricity on the part of Sir Isaac Tramber. The baronet
himself did not at once come to the point. He talked around,
hummed and hawed, and at last blurted out the truth. "Look here,
Black," he said, "you and I have been good pals&mdash;we've been
together in some queer adventures, but now I am going to&mdash;I
want&mdash;" He stammered and spluttered.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked Black with a frown.</p>

<p>"Well, to tell the truth," said Sir Isaac, with a pathetic
attempt to be firm, "I think it is about time that you and I
dissolved partnership."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Black.</p>

<p>"Well, you know, I'm getting talked about," said the other
disjointedly. "People are spreading lies about me, and one or two
chaps recently have asked me what business you and I are engaged
in, and&mdash;it's worrying me. Black." he said with the sudden
exasperation of a weak man. "I believe I have lost my chance with
Verlond because of my association with you."</p>

<p>"I see," said Black. It was a favourite expression of his. It
meant much; it meant more than usual now. "I understand," he
said, "that you think the ship is sinking, and, rat-like, you
imagine it is time to swim to the shore."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, dear old fellow," protested the other, "and
don't be unreasonable. You see how it is. When I joined you, you
were goin' to do big things&mdash;big amalgamations, big trusts,
stuffin' an' all that sort of thing. Of course," he admitted
apologetically, "I knew all about the bucket-shop, but that was a
side-line."</p>

<p>Black smiled grimly. "A pretty profitable side-line for you,"
he said dryly.</p>

<p>"I know, I know," said Ikey, patient to an offensive degree,
"but it wasn't a matter of millions an' all that, now was
it?"</p>

<p>Black was thoughtful, biting his nails and looking down at the
grass at his feet.</p>

<p>"People are talkin', dear old fellow," Tramber went on,
"sayin' the most awful rotten things. You've been promisin' this
combination with Sandford's foundries, you've practically issued
shares in Amalgamated Foundries of Europe without havin' the
goods."</p>

<p>"Sandford won't come in," said Black, without looking up,
"unless I pay him a quarter of a million cash&mdash;he'll take
the rest in shares. I want him to take his price in shares."</p>

<p>"He's no mug," said the baronet coarsely. "Old Sandford isn't
a mug&mdash;and I'll bet he's got Verlond behind him. He's no mug
either." There was a long and awkward silence&mdash;awkward for
Sir Isaac, who had an unaccountable desire to bolt.</p>

<p>"So you want to sneak out of it, do you?" said Black, meeting
his eyes with a cold smile.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear old chap," said Sir Isaac hastily, "don't take
that uncharitable view. Partnerships are always being dissolved,
it's what they're for," he said with an attempt at humour. "And I
must confess I don't like some of your schemes."</p>

<p>"You don't like!" Black turned round on him with a savage
oath. "Do you like the money you've got for it? The money paid in
advance for touting new clients? The money given to you to settle
your debts at the club? You've got to go through with it, Ikey,
and if you don't, I'll tell the whole truth to Verlond and to
every pal you've got."</p>

<p>"They wouldn't believe you," said Sir Isaac calmly. "You see,
my dear chap, you've got such an awful reputation, and the worst
of having a bad reputation is that no one believes you. If it
came to a question of believing you or believing me, who do you
think Society would believe&mdash;a man of some position, one in
the baronetage of Great Britain, or a man&mdash;well, not to put
too fine a point on it&mdash;like you?"</p>

<p>Black looked at him long and steadily. "Whatever view you
take," he said slowly, "you've got to stand your corner. If, as a
result of any of the business we are now engaged in, I am
arrested, I shall give information to the police concerning you.
We are both in the same boat&mdash;we sink or swim together."</p>

<p>He noticed the slow-spreading alarm on Sir Isaac's face. "Look
here," he said, "I'll arrange to pay you back that money I've
got. I'll give you bills&mdash;"</p>

<p>Black laughed. "You're an amusing devil," he said. "You and
your bills! I can write bills myself, can't I? I'd as soon take a
crossing-sweeper's bills as yours. Why, there's enough of your
paper in London to feed Sandford's furnaces for a week." The
words suggested a thought. "Let's say no more about this matter
till after the amalgamation. It's coming off next week. It may
make all the difference in our fortune, Ikey," he said in gentler
tones. "Just drop the idea of ratting."</p>

<p>"I'm not ratting," protested the other. "I'm
merely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," said Black. "You're merely taking
precautions&mdash;well, that's all the rats do. You're in this up
to your neck&mdash;don't deceive yourself. You can't get out of
it until I say 'Go.'"</p>

<p>"It will be awkward for me if the game is exposed," said Sir
Isaac, biting his nails. "It will be jolly unpleasant if it is
discovered I am standing in with you."</p>

<p>"It will be more awkward for you," answered Black ominously,
"if, at the psychological moment, you are not standing in with
me."</p>

<p>Theodore Sandford, a busy man, thrust his untidy grey head
into the door of his daughter's sitting-room. "May," said he,
"don't forget that I am giving a dinner to-night in your
honour&mdash;for unless my memory is at fault and the cheque you
found on your breakfast-tray was missupplied, you are twenty-two
to-day."</p>

<p>She blew him a kiss. "Who is coming?" she asked. "I ought
really to have invited everybody myself."</p>

<p>"Can't stop to tell you" said her father with a smile. "I'm
sorry you quarrelled with young Fellowe. I should like to have
asked him."</p>

<p>She smiled gaily. "I shall have to get another policeman," she
said.</p>

<p>He looked at her for a long time. "Fellowe isn't an ordinary
policeman," he said quietly. "Do you know that I saw him dining
with the Home Secretary the other day?"</p>

<p>Her eyebrows rose. "In uniform?" she asked.</p>

<p>He laughed. "No, you goose," he chuckled, "in his
dressing-gown."</p>

<p>She followed him down the corridor. "You've learnt that from
Lord Verlond," she said reproachfully. She waited till the car
had carried her father from view, then walked back to her room,
happy with the happiness which anticipates happiness.</p>

<p>The night before had been a miserable one till, acting on an
impulse, she had humbled herself, and found strange joy in the
humiliation. The knowledge that this young man was still her
ideal, all she would have him to be, had so absorbed her that for
the time being she was oblivious of all else. She recalled with a
little start the occasion of their last meeting, and how they had
parted. The recollection made her supremely miserable again, and,
jumping up from her stool, she had opened her little
writing-bureau and scribbled a hurried, penitent, autocratic
little note, ordering and imploring him to come to her the
instant he received it.</p>

<p>Frank came promptly. The maid announced his arrival within ten
minutes of Mr. Sandford's departure.</p>

<p>May ran lightly downstairs and was seized with a sudden fit of
shyness as she reached the library door. She would have paused,
but the maid, who was following her, regarded her with so much
sympathetic interest that she was obliged to assume a nonchalance
that she was far from feeling and enter the room.</p>

<p>Frank was standing with his back to the door, but he turned
quickly on hearing the light rustle of her gown. May closed the
door, but she made no effort to move away from it. "How do you
do?" she began. The effort she was making to still the wild
beating of her heart made her voice sound cold and formal.</p>

<p>"I am very well, thank you." Frank's tone reflected her
own.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wanted to see you," she continued, with an effort
to appear natural.</p>

<p>"So I gathered from your note," he replied.</p>

<p>"It was good of you to come," she went on conventionally. "I
hope it has not inconvenienced you at all."</p>

<p>"Not at all." Again Frank's voice was an expressive echo. "I
was just on the point of going out, so came at once."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am sorry&mdash;won't you keep your other appointment
first? Any time will suit me; it&mdash;it is nothing
important."</p>

<p>"Well, I hadn't an appointment exactly." It was the young
man's turn to hesitate. "To tell the truth, I was coming
here."</p>

<p>"Oh, Frank! Were you really?"</p>

<p>"Yes, really and truly, little girl." May did not answer, but
something Frank saw in her face spoke more plainly than words
could do.</p>

<p>Mr. Sandford returned that afternoon to find two happy people
sitting in the half-darkness of the drawing-room; and ten members
of the Criminal Investigation Department waited at Scotland Yard,
alternately swearing and wringing their hands.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16">XVI.&mdash;COLONEL BLACK MEETS A
JUST MAN</a></h2>

<p class="first">DR. ESSLEY'S house at Forest Hill stood
untenanted. The red lamp before the door was unlit, and though
the meagre furnishings had not been removed, the house, with its
drawn blinds and grimy steps, had the desolate appearance of
emptiness.</p>

<p>The whisper of a rumour had agitated the domestic circles of
that respectable suburb&mdash;a startling rumour which, if it
were true, might well cause Forest Hill to gasp in righteous
indignation. "Dr." Essley was an unauthorized practitioner, a
fraud of the worst description, for he had taken the name and the
style of a dead man.</p>

<p>"All I know," explained Colonel Black, whom a reporter
discovered at his office, "is that I met Dr. Essley in Australia,
and that I was impressed by his skill. I might say," he added in
a burst of frankness, "that I am in a sense responsible for his
position in England, for I not only advanced him money to buy his
practice, but I recommended him to all my friends, and naturally
I am upset by the revelation."</p>

<p>No, he had no idea as to the "doctor's" present location. He
had last seen him a month before, when the "doctor" spoke of
going to the Continent.</p>

<p>Colonel Black had as much to tell&mdash;and no more&mdash;to
the detectives who came from Scotland Yard. They came with
annoying persistence and never seemed tired of coming. They
waited for him on the doorstep and in his office. They waited for
him in the vestibules of the theatres, at the entrance doors of
banks. They came as frequently as emissaries of houses to whom
Colonel Black was under monetary obligation.</p>

<p>A week after the events chronicled in the last chapter.
Colonel Black sat alone in his flat with a light heart. He had
collected together a very considerable amount of money. That it
was money to which he had no legal right did not disturb the
smooth current of his thoughts. It was sufficient that it was
money, and that a motor-car which might carry him swiftly to
Folkestone was within telephone-call day and night. Moreover, he
was alive.</p>

<p>The vengeance of an organization vowed against Dr. Essley had
passed over the head of Colonel Black&mdash;he might be excused
if he thought that the matter of a grey wig and a pair of shaggy
eyebrows, added to some knowledge of medicine, had deceived the
astute men who had come to England to track him down.</p>

<p>This infernal man Fellowe, who appeared and disappeared as if
by magic, puzzled him&mdash;almost alarmed him. Fellowe was not
one of the Four Just Men&mdash;instinct told him that much.
Fellowe was an official.</p>

<p>A Sergeant Gurden who had been extremely useful to Black had
been suddenly transferred to a remote division, and nobody knew
why. With him had disappeared from his familiar beats a young
police-constable who had been seen dining with Cabinet Ministers.
It was very evident that there was cause for
perturbation&mdash;yet, singularity enough, Colonel Black was
cheerful; but there was a malignant quality to his cheerfulness.
He busied himself with the destruction of such of his
papers&mdash;and they were few&mdash;which he had kept by
him.</p>

<p>He turned out an old pocket-book and frowned when he saw its
contents. It was a wagon-lit coupon for the journey from Paris to
Madrid, and was made out in the name of Dr. Essley&mdash;a mad
slip which might have led to serious consequences, he told
himself. He burnt the incriminating sheet and crumbled the ashes
before he threw them into the fire-place.</p>

<p>It was dark before he had finished his preparations, but he
made no attempt to light the room. His dress-suit was laid out in
an adjoining room, his trunks stood packed. He looked at his
watch. In half an hour he would be on his way to the Sandfords.
Here was another risk which none but a madman would take&mdash;so
he told himself, but he contemplated the outcome of his visit
with equanimity.</p>

<p>He went into his bedroom and began his preparations, then
remembered that he had left a bundle of notes on his
writing-table, and went back. He found the notes and was
returning when there was a click, and the room was flooded with
light.</p>

<p>He whipped round with an oath, dropping his hand to his
hip-pocket.</p>

<p>"Don't move, please," quietly.</p>

<p>"You!" gasped Black.</p>

<p>The tall man with the little pointed beard nodded. "Keep your
hand away from your pocket, colonel," he said; "there is no
immediate danger."</p>

<p>He was unarmed. The thin cigar between his white teeth
testified his serenity. "De la Monte!" stammered Black.</p>

<p>Again the bearded man nodded. "The last time we met was in
Cordova," he said, "but you have changed since then."</p>

<p>Black forced a smile.</p>

<p>"You are confusing me with Dr. Essley," he said.</p>

<p>"I am confusing you with Dr. Essley," agreed the other. "Yet I
think I am justified in my confusion."</p>

<p>He did not remove his cigar, seemed perfectly at ease, even
going so far as to cast an eye upon a chair, inviting invitation.
"Essley or Black," he said steadily, "your day is already dusk,
and the night is very near."</p>

<p>A cold wave of terror swept over the colonel. He tried to
speak, but his throat and his mouth were dry, and he could only
make inarticulate noises. "To-night&mdash;now?" he
croaked&mdash;his shaking hands went up to his mouth. Yet he was
armed and the man before him bore no weapon. A quick movement of
his hand and he would lay the spectre which had at one time
terrorized Europe. He did not doubt that he was face to face with
one of the dreaded Four, and he found himself endeavouring to
memorize the face of the man before him for future use. Yet he
did not touch the pistol which lay snug in his hip-pocket. He was
hypnotized, paralysed by the cool confidence of the other. All
that he knew was that he wanted the relief which could only come
if this calm man were to go. He felt horribly trapped, saw no way
of escape in the presence of this force.</p>

<p>The other divined what was going on in Black's mind.</p>

<p>"I have only one piece of advice to offer you," he said, "and
that is this&mdash;keep away from the Sandfords' dinner."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why?" stammered Black.</p>

<p>The other walked to the fire-place and flicked the ash of his
cigar into the grate.</p>

<p>"Because," he said, without turning round, "at the Sandford
dinner you come within the jurisdiction of the Four Just
Men&mdash;who, as you may know, are a protecting force.
Elsewhere&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;elsewhere?"</p>

<p>"You come within the jurisdiction of the law. Colonel Black,
for at this present moment an energetic young
Assistant-Commissioner of Police is applying for a warrant for
your arrest on the charge of murder." With a little nod, Manfred
turned his back and walked leisurely towards the door.</p>

<p>"Stop!" The words were hissed. Black, revolver in hand, was
livid with rage and fear.</p>

<p>Manfred laughed quietly. He did not check his walk, but looked
backward over his shoulder. "Let the cobbler stick to his last,"
he quoted. "Poison, my dear colonel, is your last&mdash;or the
knife in the case of Jakobs. An explosion, even of a Webley
revolver, would shatter your nerves."</p>

<p>He opened the door and walked out, closing it carefully behind
him. Black sank into the nearest chair, his mouth working, the
perspiration streaming down his face. This was the end. He was a
spent force. He crossed the room to the telephone and gave a
number. After a little while he got an answer.</p>

<p>Yes, the car was in readiness; there had been no inquiries. He
hung up the telephone and called up six depots where cars could
be hired. To each he gave the same instructions. Two cars were to
be waiting&mdash;he changed the locality with each order. Two
fast cars, each able to cover the eighty miles to Dover without
fear of a breakdown.</p>

<p>"I shall take one," he said, "the other must follow
immediately behind&mdash;yes, empty. I am going to Dover to meet
a party of people." He would take no risk of a breakdown. The
second car must be close at hand in case he had an accident with
the first.</p>

<p>He was something of an organizer. In the short space of time
he was at the telephone, he arranged the cars so that whatever
avenue of escape he was forced to take he would find the vehicles
waiting. This done, he completed his dressing. The reaction from
the fear had come. He was filled with black hate for the men who
had put a period to his career of villainy. Most of all he hated
Sandford, the man who could have saved him. He would take the
risk of the Four&mdash;take his chance with the police.
Curiously, he feared the police least of all. One final blow he
would strike and break the man whose obstinacy had broken
him.</p>

<p>He was mad with anger&mdash;he saw nothing but the fulfilment
of his plan of revenge. He went into his room, unlocked a
cupboard and took out the green bottle. There was no need for the
feather, he would do the job thoroughly.</p>

<p>He finished his dressing, pocketed his bank-notes, and slipped
the little green bottle into his waistcoat pocket. One last look
round he gave, then, with a sense of the old exhilaration which
had been his before the arrival of Manfred, he put on his hat,
threw an overcoat over his arm and went out.</p>

<p>It was a gay little party that assembled at the Great South
Central Hotel. May Sandford had invited a girl friend, and Mr.
Sandford had brought back the junior partner of one of the City
houses he did business with. Black was late and did not arrive
till a quarter of an hour after the time settled for dinner.
Sandford had given orders for the meal to be served when the
colonel came in.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Black," said Sandford. There was a chair between
the ironmaster and his daughter, and into this he dropped. His
hand shook as he took up the spoon to his soup. He put the spoon
down again and unfolded his serviette. A letter dropped out. He
knew those grey envelopes now, and crushed the letter into his
pocket without attempting to read it.</p>

<p>"Busy man, Black, eh?" smiled Sandford. He was a florid,
hearty man with a wisp of white whisker on either side of his
rubicund face, and in his pleasant moments he was a very lovable
man. "You ought to be grateful I did not agree to the
amalgamations&mdash;you would have been worked to death."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the colonel shortly. He stuck out his jaw&mdash;a
trick he had when he was perturbed.</p>

<p>"In a way," bantered the elder man, "you're an admirable chap.
If you were a little more reasonable you would be more
successful."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you call me successful?"</p>

<p>Sandford pouted thoughtfully. "Yes and no," he said. "You are
not altogether successful. You see, you have achieved what you
would call success too easily."</p>

<p>Colonel Black did not pursue the subject, nor did he encourage
the other to go any further. He needed opportunity. For a time he
had to sit patiently, joining in, with such scraps of speech as
he could muster, the conversation that rippled about him.</p>

<p>At his left hand were the girl's wine-glasses. She refused the
lighter wines and drew forth a laughing protest from her
father.</p>

<p>"Dearie, on your birthday&mdash;you must sip some
champagne!"</p>

<p>"Champagne, then!" she said gaily. She was happy for many
reasons, but principally because&mdash;well, just because.</p>

<p>That was the opportunity. Absent-mindedly he drew her glass
nearer, then he found the bottle in his pocket. With one hand he
removed the cork and spilt half the contents of the phial on to
his serviette. He re-corked the bottle and slipped it into his
pocket. He took the glass on to his lap. Twice he wiped the edge
of it with the damp napkin. He replaced the glass unnoticed.</p>

<p>Now it was done he felt better. He leant back in his chair,
his hands thrust deep into his trousers pockets. It was an
inelegant attitude, but he derived a sense of comfort.</p>

<p>"Black, wake up, my dear fellow!" Sandford was talking to him,
and he roused himself with a start. "My friend here was rude
enough to comment on your hair."</p>

<p>"Eh?" Black put up his hand to his head.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right and it isn't disarranged&mdash;but how
long has it been white?"</p>

<p>"White?" He had heard of such things and was mildly
interested. "White? Oh&mdash;er&mdash;quite a time."</p>

<p>He did not further the discussion. The waiters were filling
the glasses. He looked across to Sandford. How happy, how
self-sufficient he was. He intercepted the tender little looks
that passed between father and daughter. There was perfect
sympathy between the two. It was a pity that in a minute or so
one should be dead and the other broken. She so full of life, so
splendid of shape, so fresh and lovely. He turned his head and
looked at her. Curious, very curious, how frail a thing is life,
that a milligram of a colourless fluid should be sufficient to
snap the cord that binds soul to body. The waiter filled the
glasses&mdash;first the girl's, then his.</p>

<p>He raised his own with unconcern and drank it off.</p>

<p>The girl did not touch hers. She was talking to the man on her
left. Black could see only the rounded cheek and one white
shoulder. He waited impatiently.</p>

<p>Sandford tried to bring him into the conversation, but he
refused to be drawn. He was content to listen, he said. To
listen, to watch and to wait. He saw the slim white fingers close
round the stem of the glass, saw her half raise it, still looking
towards her partner. Black pushed his chair a little to one side
as the glass reached her lips. She drank, not much, but enough.
The colonel held his breath. She replaced the glass, still
talking with the man on her left.</p>

<p>Black counted the slow seconds. He counted sixty&mdash;a
hundred, oblivious to the fact that Sandford was talking to him.
The drug had failed!</p>

<p>"Are you ill, colonel?"</p>

<p>Everybody was staring at him.</p>

<p>"Ill?" he repeated hoarsely. "No, I am not ill&mdash;why
should I be ill?"</p>

<p>"Open one of those windows, waiter."</p>

<p>A blast of cold air struck him and he shivered. He left the
table hurriedly and went blundering blindly from the room. There
was an end to it all. In the corridor of the hotel he came in his
haste into collision with a man. It was the man who had called
upon him some time before.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said the man, catching his arm. "Colonel Black, I
believe."</p>

<p>"Stand out of my way."</p>

<p>Black spat out the words savagely.</p>

<p>"I am Detective-Sergeant Kay from Scotland Yard, and shall
take you into custody."</p>

<p>At the first hint of danger the colonel drew back. Suddenly
his fist shot out and caught the officer under the jaw. It was a
terrific blow and the detective was unprepared. He went down like
a log.</p>

<p>The corridor was empty. Leaving the man upon the floor, the
fugitive sped into the lobby. He was hatless, but he shaded his
face and passed through the throng in the vestibule into the open
air. He signalled a taxi. "Waterloo, and I will give you a pound
if you catch my train."</p>

<p>He was speeding down the Strand in less than a minute. He
changed his instructions before the station was reached.</p>

<p>"I have lost the train&mdash;drop me at the corner of Eaton
Square."</p>

<p>At Eaton Square he paid the cabman and dismissed him. With
little difficulty he found two closed cars that waited.</p>

<p>"I am Colonel Black," he said, and the first chauffeur touched
his cap. "Take the straightest road to Southampton and let the
second man follow behind." The car had not gone far before he
changed his mind. "Go first to the Junior Turf Club in Pall
Mall," he said.</p>

<p>Arrived at the club, he beckoned the porter. "Tell Sir Isaac
Tramber that he is wanted at once," he directed.</p>

<p>Ikey was in the club&mdash;it was a chance shot of the
colonel's, but it bagged his man.</p>

<p>"Get your coat and hat," said Black hurriedly to the flustered
baronet.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No buts," snarled the other savagely. "Get your coat and hat,
unless you want to be hauled out of your club to the nearest
police-station."</p>

<p>Reluctantly Ikey went back to the club and returned in a few
seconds struggling into his great-coat. "Now what the devil is
this all about?" he demanded peevishly; then, as the light of a
street lamp caught the colonel's uncovered head, he gasped: "Good
Lord! Your hair has gone white! You look just like that fellow
Essley!"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap17" id="chap17">XVII.&mdash;CHAPTER THE LAST.
JUSTICE</a></h2>

<p class="first">"WHERE are we going?" asked Sir Isaac
faintly.</p>

<p>"We are going to Southampton," growled Black in his ear. "We
shall find some friends there." He grinned in the darkness. Then,
leaning forward, he gave instructions in a low tone to the
chauffeur.</p>

<p>The car jerked forward and in a few minutes it had crossed
Hammersmith Broadway and was speeding towards Barnes.</p>

<p>Scarcely had it cleared the traffic when a long grey racing
car cut perilously across the crowded space, dodging with
extraordinary agility a number of vehicles, and, unheeding the
caustic comments of the drivers, it went on in the same direction
as Black's car had taken.</p>

<p>He had cleared Kingston and was on the Sandown road when he
heard the loud purring of a car behind. He turned and looked,
expecting to find his second car, but a punctured tyre held
Black's reserve on Putney Heath. Black was a little uneasy,
though it was no unusual thing for cars to travel the main
Portsmouth road at that hour of the night. He knew, too, that he
could not hope to keep ahead of his pursuer. He caught the
unmistakable sound which accompanies the racing car in motion.
"We'll wait till the road gets a little broader," he said, "and
then we'll let that chap pass us."</p>

<p>He conveyed the gist of this intention to the chauffeur. The
car behind showed no disposition to go ahead until Sandown and
Cobham had been left behind and the lights of Guildford were
almost in sight. Then, on a lonely stretch of road, two miles
from the town, the car, without any perceptible effort, shot
level with them and then drew ahead on the off side. Then it
slowed, and the touring car had perforce to follow its
example.</p>

<p>Black watched the manoeuvre with some misgiving. Slower and
slower went the racing car till it stopped crossways in the road;
it stopped, too, in a position which made it impossible for the
touring car to pass. Black's man drew up with a jerk.</p>

<p>They saw, by the light of their lamps, two men get out of the
motor ahead and make what seemed to be a cursory examination of a
wheel. Then one walked back, slowly and casually, till he came to
where Black and his companion sat.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said the stranger. "I think I know you."</p>

<p>Of a sudden an electric lamp flashed in Black's face. More to
the point, in the spreading rays of the light, clear to be seen
was the nickel-plated barrel of a revolver, and it was pointed
straight at Black. "You will alight, Mr. Black&mdash;you and your
companion," said the unknown calmly.</p>

<p>In the bright light that flooded him, Black could make no
move. Without a word he stepped down on to the roadway, his
companion following him. "Go ahead," said the man with the
revolver.</p>

<p>The two obeyed. Another flood of light met them. The driver of
the first car was standing up, electric torch in one hand,
revolver in the other. He directed them curtly to enter the
tonneau. The first of their captors turned to give directions to
the chauffeur of the grey touring car, then he sprang into the
body in which they sat and took a seat opposite them.</p>

<p>"Put your hands on your knees," he commanded, as his little
lamp played over them.</p>

<p>Black brought his gloved hands forward reluctantly. Sir Isaac,
half dead with fright, followed his example.</p>

<p>They struck off from the main road and took a narrow country
lane which was unfamiliar to Black, and for ten minutes they
twisted and turned in what seemed the heart of the country. Then
they stopped. "Get down!" ordered the man with the lamp. Neither
Black nor his friend had spoken one word up till now.</p>

<p>"What is the game?" asked Black.</p>

<p>"Get down!" commanded the other. With a curse, the big man
descended. There were two other men waiting for them.</p>

<p>"I suppose this is the Four Just Men farce," said Black with a
sneer.</p>

<p>"That you shall learn," said one of those who were
waiting.</p>

<p>They were conducted by a long, rough path through a field,
through a little copse, until ahead of them in the night loomed a
small building. It was in darkness. It gave Black the impression
of being a chapel. He had little time to take any note of its
construction. He heard Sir Isaac's quick breathing behind him and
the snick of a lock. The hand that held his arm now relaxed.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are," said a voice. Black waited. There was
growing in his heart a sickly fear of what all this signified.
"Step forward," said a voice. Black moved two steps forward and
suddenly the big room in which he stood blazed with light. He
raised his hand to protect his eyes from the dazzling glow.</p>

<p>The sight he saw was a remarkable one. He was in a chapel; he
saw the stained-glass windows, but in place of the altar there
was a low platform which ran along one end of the building. It
was draped with black and set with three desks. It reminded him
of nothing so much as a judge's desk, save that the hangings were
of purple, the desks of black oak, and the carpet that covered
the dais of the same sombre hue.</p>

<p>Three men sat at the desks. They were masked, and a diamond
pin in the cravat of one glittered in the light of the huge
electrolier which hung from the vaulted roof. Gonsalez had a
weakness for jewels.</p>

<p>The remaining member of the Four was to the right of the
prisoners.</p>

<p>With the stained-glass windows, the raftered roof, and the
solemn character of the architecture, the illusion of the chapel
ended. There was no other furniture on the floor; it was tiled
and bare of chair or pew.</p>

<p>Black took all this in quickly. He noted a door behind the
three, through which they came and apparently made their exit. He
could see no means of escape save by the way he had come.</p>

<p>The central figure of the three at the desk spoke in a voice
which was harsh and stern and uncompromising. "Morris Black," he
said solemnly, "what of Fanks?"</p>

<p>Black shrugged his shoulders and looked round as though weary
of a question which he found it impossible to answer.</p>

<p>"What of Jakobs, of Coleman, of a dozen men who have stood in
your way and have died?" asked the voice.</p>

<p>Still Black was silent. His eye took in the situation. Behind
him were two doors, and he observed that the key was in the lock.
He could see that he was in an old Norman chapel which private
enterprise had restored for a purpose.</p>

<p>The door was modern and of the usual "churchy" type.</p>

<p>"Isaac Tramber," said Number One, "what part have you
played?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," stammered Sir Isaac. "I am as much in the dark
as you are. I think the bucket-shop idea is perfectly beastly.
Now look here, is there anything else I can tell you, because I
am most anxious to get out of this affair with clean hands?"</p>

<p>He made a step forward and Black reached out a hand to
restrain him, but was pulled back by the man at his side.</p>

<p>"Come here," said Number One. His knees shaking under him, Sir
Isaac walked quickly up the aisle floor.</p>

<p>"I'll do anything I can," he said eagerly, as he stood like a
penitent boy before the master's figure. "Any information I can
give you I shall be most happy to give."</p>

<p>"Stop!" roared Black. His face was livid with rage. "Stop," he
said hoarsely, "you don't know what you're doing, Ikey. Keep your
mouth shut and stand by me and you'll not suffer."</p>

<p>"There is only one thing I know," Sir Isaac went on, "and that
is that Black had a bit of a row with Fanks&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth when three shots rang
out in rapid succession. The Four had not attempted to disarm
Black. With lightning-like rapidity he had whipped out his
Browning pistol and had fired at the traitor.</p>

<p>In a second he was at the door. An instant later the key was
turned and he was through.</p>

<p>"Shoot&mdash;shoot, Manfred," said a voice from the dais. But
they were too late&mdash;Black had vanished into the darkness. As
the two men sprang after him, they stood for a moment silhouetted
against the light from the chapel within. "Crack! crack!" A
nickel bullet struck the stone supports of the doorway and
covered them with fine dust and splinters of stone.</p>

<p>"Put the lights out and follow," said Manfred quickly.</p>

<p>He was too late, for Black had a start, and the fear and
hatred in him lent him unsuspected speed. The brute instinct in
him led him across the field unerringly. He reached the tiny
road, fumed to the left, and found the grey racing car waiting,
unattended.</p>

<p>He sprang to the crank and turned it. He was in the driver's
seat in an instant. He had to take risks&mdash;there might be
ditches on either side of the road, but he turned the wheel over
till it almost locked and brought his foot down over the pedal.
The car jumped forward, lurched to the side, recovered itself,
and went bumping and crashing along the road.</p>

<p>"It's no good," said Manfred. He saw the tail-lights of the
car disappearing. "Let's get back." He had slipped off his
mask.</p>

<p>They raced back to the chapel. The lights were on again. Sir
Isaac Tramber lay stone-dead on the floor. The bullet had struck
him in the left shoulder and had passed through this heart. But
it was not to him they looked. Number One lay still and
motionless on the floor in a pool of blood.</p>

<p>"Look to the injury," he said, "and unless it is fatal do not
unmask me."</p>

<p>Poiccart and Gonsalez made a brief examination of the wound.
"It's pretty serious."</p>

<p>In this terse sentence they summarized their judgment. "I
thought it was," said the wounded man quietly. "You had better
get on to Southampton. He'll probably pick up Fellowe"&mdash;he
smiled through his mask&mdash;"I suppose I ought to call him Lord
Francis Ledborough now. He's a nephew of mine and a sort of a
police-commissioner himself. I wired him to follow me. You might
pick up his car and go on together. Manfred can stay with me.
Take this mask off."</p>

<p>Gonsalez stooped down and gently removed the silk half-mask.
Then he started back.</p>

<p>"Lord Verlond!" he exclaimed with surprise, and Manfred, who
knew, nodded.</p>

<p>The road was clear of traffic at this hour of the night. It
was dark and none too wide in places for a man who had not
touched the steering-wheel of a car for some years, but Black,
bareheaded, sat and drove the big machine ahead without fear of
consequences. Once he went rocking through a little town at
racing speed.</p>

<p>A policeman who attempted to hold him up narrowly escaped with
his life. Black reached open road again with no injury save a
shattered mud-guard that had caught a lamp-post on a sharp turn.
He went through Winchester at top speed&mdash;again there was an
attempt to stop him. Two big wagons had been drawn up in the main
street, but he saw them in time and took a side turning, and
cleared the town again more by good luck than otherwise. He knew now that his flight was known to the police. He must change his
plans. He admitted to himself that he had few plans to change: he
had arranged to leave England by one of two ports, Dover or
Southampton. He had hoped to reach the Havre boat without
attracting attention, but that was now out of the question. The
boats would be watched, and he had no disguise which would help
him.</p>

<p>Eight miles south of Winchester he overtook another car and
passed it before he realized that this must be the second car he
had hired. With the realization came two reports&mdash;the front
tyres of his car had punctured. His foot pressed on the brake and
he slowed the car to a standstill. Here was luck! To come to
grief at the very spot where his relief was at hand!</p>

<p>He jumped out of the car and stood revealed in the glare of
the lamps of the oncoming car, his arms outstretched. The car
drew up within a few feet of him. "Take me on to Southampton; I
have broken down," he said, and the chauffeur said something
unintelligible.</p>

<p>Black opened the door of the car and stepped in. The door
slammed behind him before he was aware that there were other
occupants. "Who&mdash;?" he began. Then two hands seized him,
something cold and hard snapped on his wrists, and a familiar
voice said: "I am Lord Francis Ledborough, an
assistant-commissioner of police, and I shall take you into
custody on a charge of wilful murder."</p>

<p>"Ledborough?" repeated Black dully.</p>

<p>"You know me best as Constable Fellowe," said the voice.</p>

<p>Black was hanged at Pentonville gaol on the 27th of March,
19&mdash;, and Lord Francis Ledborough, sitting by the side of an
invalid uncle's bed, read such meagre descriptions as were given
to the press.</p>

<p>"Did you know him, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>The old earl turned fretfully.</p>

<p>"Know him?" he snarled. "Of course I knew him; he is the only
friend of mine that has ever been hanged."</p>

<p>"Where did you meet him?" persisted a sceptical A.C. of
Police.</p>

<p>"I never met him," said the old man grimly, "he met me."</p>

<p>And he made a little grimace, for the wound in his shoulder
was still painful.</p>
